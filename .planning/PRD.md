# Goops - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

**Goops** is a puzzle-action game where you operate as a tank maintenance technician, clearing colorful goop from a cylindrical pressure tank while managing equipment malfunctions. The game combines spatial puzzle-solving with time pressure and multi-tasking.

**Platform:** Mobile-first web game (React/TypeScript/Vite)
**Session Length:** 75 seconds per shift (base, upgradeable to 115s max)

### Core Fantasy

You're a low-level operator at an industrial facility. Your job: peer through a periscope into a cylindrical tank, drop goop to seal pressure cracks, laser away excess goop, and keep the equipment running. It's mundane. It's stressful. The tank keeps filling. The equipment keeps breaking. You keep playing.

### Win/Lose Conditions

**Win:** Seal the required number of cracks before pressure reaches 100%
- Required cracks = number of colors in palette + current rank
- Example: Rank 5 with 4 colors = 9 cracks to seal
- After winning, gameplay continues until pressure hits 100% (bonus opportunity)

**Lose:** Pressure reaches 100% with fewer than required cracks sealed

---

## Game Modes

### Console Screen

The main menu and meta-game layer. A retro industrial control console (think Homer Simpson at the nuclear plant).

**Elements:**
- Operator Rank display with XP bar
- Three complication repair panels (Laser, Lights, Controls)
- Status lights and gauges
- Periscope handle (pull down to enter gameplay)
- End Shift screen (CRT monitor that drops down on game over)

**Console Light States:**
- **Idle:** All orange lights blink slowly at varied speeds
- **During gameplay:** All lights blink faster
- **Active complication:** Affected section goes solid (not blinking)

**Mid-Run Display:**
- Alternates between "Cleaning in Progress..." and "Current Pressure: XX%"

### Tank Screen (Periscope Mode)

The core gameplay. You look into a cylindrical tank through a viewport showing ~40% of the tank surface.

**Core Loop:**
1. Pressure builds continuously (75-second timer)
2. Cracks appear at the pressure line
3. Goop pieces fall from center of screen
4. Rotate the tank to position where goop should land
5. Match colored goop to cracks
6. Pop goop to seal cracks and reduce pressure
7. Handle equipment malfunctions when they occur

### End Shift Screen

Displays when the shift ends (pressure reaches 100%).

**Header:** "SHIFT OVER" or "SYSTEM FAILURE"

**Stats Shown:**
- Shift Score (XP earned)
- Operator Rank with XP bar
- Grade (A/B/C/FAILURE)
- Cracks Filled (X/Y)
- Pressure Vented (time recovered)
- Max Mass Purged (largest pop)
- Leftover Goop (penalty count)
- Scraps available for upgrades

## The Tank

### Grid Dimensions

| Property | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Total Width | 30 columns | Full cylinder circumference |
| Visible Width | 12 columns | ~40% visible through periscope |
| Total Height | 19 rows | Including buffer |
| Visible Height | 16 rows | Rows 3-18 (0-indexed) |
| Buffer Height | 3 rows | Spawn area above visible (rows 0-2) |

The tank is cylindrical — coordinates wrap horizontally. Rotating the tank changes which section is visible. Goop groups can wrap around the cylinder.

> **Tech Note:** Buffer rows 0-2 are not visible to the player. Pieces spawn at row 0 and fall into the visible area starting at row 3.

### Pressure System

Pressure represents time remaining. It builds continuously and determines:
- Which goop can be popped (must be below pressure line)
- Where cracks spawn (at pressure line)
- Game over condition (100% pressure)

**Visual:** Water level rising from bottom. At 0% pressure, only the bottom row is submerged. At 100%, the entire tank is "underwater."

**Formulas:**
```
tankPressure = 1 - (shiftTime / maxTime)
waterHeightBlocks = 1 + (tankPressure * 15)
pressureLineY = floor(TANK_HEIGHT - waterHeightBlocks)
```

> **Tech Note:** `pressureLineY` ranges from row 18 (bottom, at game start) to row 3 (top, constrained by BUFFER_HEIGHT at game end).

**Pressure Recovery (from popping goop):**
```
unitRecovery = groupSize * 100ms
tierBonus = tier * 250ms (tier = floor((groupSize - 15) / 10), min 0)
infusedBonus = infusedUnitCount * 3000ms
totalRecovery = unitRecovery + tierBonus + infusedBonus
```

Infused goop = goop covering a matching-color crack.

## Goop System

### Piece Shapes

Pieces come in three size categories, spawning based on elapsed time:

| Zone | Time Range | Shapes | Cells per Piece |
|------|------------|--------|-----------------|
| Tetra | 0 to maxTime/3 | 5 normal + 5 corrupted | 4 |
| Penta | maxTime/3 to 2×maxTime/3 | 11 normal + 11 corrupted | 5 |
| Hexa | 2×maxTime/3 to maxTime | 11 normal + 11 corrupted | 6 |

**Total:** 54 unique shapes (27 normal + 27 corrupted)

> **Tech Note:** Zone boundaries adjust with PRESSURE_CONTROL upgrade. At base 75s: zones are 0-25s, 25-50s, 50-75s. With max upgrade (115s): zones are 0-38.3s, 38.3-76.7s, 76.7-115s.

Bigger pieces spawn later because cracks appear higher as pressure rises — taller pieces help reach them.

### Piece Spawning

Goop always falls from the center of the visible screen. The player controls WHERE it lands by rotating the tank underneath it.

**Spawning Mechanics:**
- **Corruption:** 15% chance to spawn corrupted variant (non-contiguous cells)
- **Mirroring:** 50% chance to flip asymmetric pieces horizontally
- **Multi-color:** 25% chance at rank 20+ (cells split between 2 colors)
- **Wild:** 15% chance at rank 40+ (seals any crack color)

**Spawn Priority Order:**
1. Check corruption (15%)
2. If corrupted: cannot be wild or multi-color
3. If normal: check wild (15% at rank 40+)
4. If not wild: check multi-color split (25% at rank 20+)
5. Apply mirroring (50% for asymmetric shapes)

**Wild Piece Rules:**
- Only spawn from normal pools (never corrupted)
- Cannot be multi-color
- Seal any crack color on contact
- Convert adjacent goop groups to wild on lock
- When non-wild lands next to wild, entire wild group converts to that color

### Corrupted Pieces

Corrupted pieces have corner-touching cells instead of edge-touching. After locking:
- `updateGroups()` recomputes connectivity — corner-touching cells become separate groups
- Unsupported groups fall as individual loose goop
- Cannot become multi-color (mixed)
- Cannot become wild

> **Tech Note:** The `isCorrupted` flag is set at spawn time in `GoopTemplate`. After merge, `updateGroups()` uses 4-way (orthogonal) connectivity, so corner-connected cells naturally separate.

### Goop Physics

**Groups:** Connected same-color cells form a "goop group" (4-way orthogonal connectivity only)

**Support:** A group is supported if ANY cell touches:
- The floor (bottom row, y = TANK_HEIGHT - 1 = row 18)
- Another supported group (directly below, same column)

**Falling:** Unsupported groups become "loose goop" and fall at 0.03 grid units/ms

**Merging:** When same-color groups touch, they merge into one group with a new timestamp

### Goop Filling

After placement or merge, goop "fills" before it can be popped.

**Formula:** `fillDuration = groupSize * 375ms`

| Group Size | Fill Duration |
|------------|---------------|
| 1 cell | 375ms |
| 4 cells | 1.5s |
| 10 cells | 3.75s |
| 25 cells | 9.375s |

Fill animation progresses row-by-row from bottom to top of the group.

### Popping (Laser)

Tapping filled goop destroys it.

**Requirements:**
1. Goop must be fully filled (animation complete)
2. Top of group (`groupMinY`) must be below pressure line
3. Tap anywhere on the goop

**Results:**
- All connected same-color cells destroyed
- Unsupported goop above falls
- Score awarded
- Pressure reduced (time recovered)
- Matching cracks sealed
- Active abilities gain +25% charge per sealed crack-goop unit

---

## Crack System

### Spawning

- **Max active:** 8 crack groups (connected components) at a time
- Spawn at the current pressure line Y position
- Spawn interval: 5000ms between spawn attempts
- Random X position (must be empty cell)
- One crack per color can be "active" (spawning stops when goal target met)

### Sealing

1. Cover crack with matching-color goop (or wild goop)
2. Covered goop becomes "infused" (`isSealingGoop: true`)
3. Pop the covering goop
4. Crack disappears, counts as sealed
5. Active abilities gain +25% charge per sealed unit

**Note:** Wrong-color goop covering a crack does nothing — crack remains visible through the goop. If covering goop is removed by collapse (not direct pop), crack remains.

### Expanding Cracks (Rank 30+)

At rank 30+, unsealed cracks grow over time.

**Growth Check:** 7-12 seconds per crack cell (random: `5000 + random * 5000` ms)

**Spread Chance:**
```
baseChance = 10% + tankPressure (ranges 10% to ~100%)
slowCracksOffset = SLOW_CRACKS level * 5%
effectiveChance = baseChance - slowCracksOffset

// Penalties:
leafPenalty = 50% reduction if crack has no children (×0.5)
distancePenalty = 25% per hop from root crack (min 10% multiplier)

finalChance = effectiveChance * leafMultiplier * distanceMultiplier
```

**Spread Direction:** 8-directional (4 orthogonal + 4 diagonal)

**Merging:** Adjacent same-color cracks merge into one crack structure (parent-child references updated)

### Win Burst

When BOTH conditions are met:
- Required cracks sealed (`goalsCleared >= goalsTarget`)
- Tank not overfilled (`tankPressure < 90%`)

All remaining colors spawn cracks simultaneously above the pressure line — a bonus opportunity to seal more before the shift ends.

> **Tech Note:** If `tankPressure >= 90%` when win condition is met, all goals are cleared instead (`goalMarks = []`), effectively ending the run.

---

## Complication System

Equipment malfunctions occur based on player actions. Players start at Rank 0 with no complications, providing a safe learning period.

**Key Design:** The game does NOT pause when you exit to console. The tank keeps filling. Fix complications fast!

### Complication Overview

| Complication | Trigger | Unlock | Effect When Active |
|--------------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Laser | Capacitor empties (0%) | Rank 4 | Two-tap to pop (prime, then pop) |
| Lights | Brightness falls below 10% | Rank 2 | Dims to 5% + grayscale |
| Controls | Heat reaches 100% | Rank 6 | 2 inputs per move, 50% held speed |

### Laser Complication

**Capacitor Meter (left side of screen):**
- Starts at 100%
- Drains 4% per goop unit popped (reduced by CAPACITOR_EFFICIENCY)
- Refills +10% on piece lock (only when no active malfunction)
- Color: Blue → Yellow → Red as it empties

**Drain with upgrade:**
```
drainMultiplier = 1 - (CAPACITOR_EFFICIENCY level * 0.0625)
drainAmount = groupSize * 4 * drainMultiplier
```

**When active:** First tap primes the group (restarts fill animation), second tap pops it.

**Repair Mini-Game (4 Sliders):**
- 4 horizontal sliders with 3 positions each (Left, Center, Right)
- Each slider has 2 indicator lights (left and right)
- Match slider position to lit indicators:
  - Left light only → slide left
  - Right light only → slide right
  - Both lights → slide center
- At max CAPACITOR_EFFICIENCY: only 2 positions (no center)

### Lights Complication

**Brightness System:**
- Starts at 100%
- Grace period: 5 seconds base (+0.75s per CIRCUIT_STABILIZER level) before dimming begins
- Dims over 5 seconds from 100% to 10% when not fast dropping
- Recovers at 400%/sec while fast dropping (0.25s to full)
- Flickers at end of grace period as warning (dips to 70% for 80ms)

**When active:** Screen dims to 5% brightness with grayscale filter.

**Repair Mini-Game (Sequence Memory):**
1. Move slider to indicated position (up or down)
2. Watch 3-4 button sequence flash (200ms on, 100ms gap)
3. Repeat the sequence by pressing buttons
4. Move slider to opposite position
- At max CIRCUIT_STABILIZER: 3 buttons instead of 4

### Controls Complication

**Heat Meter (right side of screen):**
- Starts at 0%
- Gains 5% per tank rotation
- Drains 50%/sec when idle (after 200ms threshold)
- Drain boosted by GEAR_LUBRICATION: `50 * (1 + 0.125 * level)` per second
- Color: Green → Yellow → Red as it fills

**When active:** Requires 2 inputs per action, repeat rate doubled to 200ms.

**Repair Mini-Game (Dial Alignment):**
- Circular dial with arrow pointer
- 4 target positions at corners (45°, 135°, 225°, 315°)
- Align arrow within 15° of lit corner, tap to confirm
- Repeat 4 times (3 times at max GEAR_LUBRICATION)

### Cooldown

After resolving a complication, it cannot trigger again for a cooldown period:

```
cooldownSeconds = max(8, 20 - (currentRank - unlockRank))
```

Example: At rank 10, Laser (unlocks rank 4) has cooldown of max(8, 20 - 6) = 14 seconds.

---

## Progression System

### Ranks & XP

**Max Rank:** 50

**XP Formula:**
```
xpForNextRank = 3500 + (currentRank * 250)
cumulativeXpToRankN = N * (3375 + 125 * N)
```

| Rank | XP to Next | Cumulative |
|------|------------|------------|
| 0 | 3,500 | 0 |
| 10 | 6,000 | 46,250 |
| 20 | 8,500 | 117,500 |
| 30 | 11,000 | 213,750 |
| 40 | 13,500 | 335,000 |
| 50 | — | 481,250 |

**Minimum Progress:** Every session grants at least `100 * currentRank` XP (minimum 100).

### Scraps (Currency)

- Earn 1 scrap per rank achieved
- Spend 1 scrap per upgrade level
- Displayed as "SCRAPS: XX" on upgrade screen

### Color Schedule

| Rank | Colors Available |
|------|-----------------|
| 0-9 | Red, Blue, Green, Yellow (4) |
| 10-29 | + Purple (5) |
| 30-39 | + White (6) |
| 40-49 | + Wild (15% spawn chance, seals any color) |
| 50 | + Black (7) |

### Starting Junk (Rank 3+)

Sessions start with junk goop already in the tank:

| Rank | Junk Blocks | Coverage |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 0-2 | 0 | — |
| 3-5 | ~5 blocks | ~15% of bottom row |
| 6-8 | ~8 blocks | ~25% of bottom row |
| 9+ | ~11 blocks | ~35% of bottom row |

Each junk block is an independent group (size 1). Colors are random unless modified by JUNK_UNIFORMER upgrade.

## Scoring System

### Pop Scoring

```
perUnit = baseScore + heightBonus + offscreenBonus
baseScore = 10
heightBonus = (19 - y) * 10    // 0-190 points
offscreenBonus = 50            // if distance from viewport center > 6

popStreakMultiplier = 1 + (popStreak * 0.1)

// Per-unit scores are multiplied, then summed
unitTotal = sum of (perUnit * popStreakMultiplier)

// Adjacency is added flat (NOT multiplied)
adjacencyBonus = neighborGroupCount * 5

totalScore = unitTotal + adjacencyBonus
```

### Drop Scoring

```
fastDropScore = distanceDropped * 2
```

### End Game

```
goopPenalty = remainingUnits * 50
winBonus = startingRank * 5000 (if won)
xpFloor = 100 * startingRank (minimum XP)

finalScore = max(xpFloor, score + winBonus - goopPenalty)
```

**Auto-Popper Effect:** Probabilistically auto-pops remaining goop before penalty
- Base decay: 20% (80% auto-pop chance)
- Per level: -4% decay (+4% auto-pop)
- Level 4: 4% decay (96% auto-pop chance)

### Grade System

Five performance categories averaged for letter grade:

| Category | Formula |
|----------|---------|
| Crack Performance | min(100, (cracksFilled / cracksTarget) * 100) |
| Tank Efficiency | max(0, 100 - (residualGoop * 2)) |
| System Control | max(0, 100 - (residualGoop * 3)) |
| Pressure Management | min(100, (totalVented / maxTime) * 100) |
| Score Bonus | min(100, shiftScore / 100) |

**Grade Thresholds:**
| Grade | Average | Color |
|-------|---------|-------|
| A | >= 80 | Green |
| B | >= 60 | Cyan |
| C | >= 40 | Yellow |
| FAILURE | < 40 or didn't win | Red |

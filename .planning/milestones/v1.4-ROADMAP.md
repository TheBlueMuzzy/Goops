# Milestone v1.4: Naming Standardization

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-27
**Phases:** 22-24
**Total Plans:** 9

## Overview

Clean up terminology inconsistencies and establish official naming conventions throughout the codebase. Created an official glossary and systematically renamed 50+ variables, types, and functions to use consistent game terminology.

## Phases

### Phase 22: Audit & Glossary

**Goal**: Catalog all naming inconsistencies across codebase, create official glossary document
**Depends on**: v1.3 complete
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 22-01: Audit & Glossary — completed 2026-01-27

**Details:**
- Created comprehensive GLOSSARY.md defining all official game terms (9 core categories)
- Documented correct usage patterns with examples for each term
- Built prioritized rename checklist for Phase 23 execution
- Identified ~38 code changes across 10 files (initial estimate)
- Confirmed existing patterns that were already correct

### Phase 23: Code Rename

**Goal**: Apply glossary throughout codebase — rename variables, functions, comments
**Depends on**: Phase 22
**Plans**: 7 plans

Plans:
- [x] 23-01: softDrop → fastDrop — completed 2026-01-26
- [x] 23-02: Core Goop lifecycle (PieceType → GoopShape, activePiece → activeGoop) — completed 2026-01-27
- [x] 23-03: Tank dimensions & coordinates (TANK_WIDTH, tankRotation, TankCell) — completed 2026-01-27
- [x] 23-04: TankSystem & actions (ComplicationType → TankSystem, goopGroupId) — completed 2026-01-27
- [x] 23-05: Progression variables & persistence (score → sessionXP, rank → operatorRank) — completed 2026-01-27
- [x] 23-06: Screen/Phase types & Cracks (GamePhase → ScreenType, CrackCell → Crack) — completed 2026-01-27
- [x] 23-07: Remaining Goop terms (storedGoop, LooseGoop, tankPressure) — completed 2026-01-27

**Details:**
Renamed 50+ code elements across 62 files:
- **Core types:** PieceType → GoopShape, PieceDefinition → GoopTemplate, PieceState → GoopState
- **Game state:** activePiece → activeGoop, storedPiece → storedGoop, nextPiece → nextGoop
- **Grid system:** GridCell → TankCell, boardOffset → tankRotation, TOTAL_WIDTH → TANK_WIDTH
- **Complication system:** ComplicationType → TankSystem, groupId → goopGroupId, laserCapacitor → laserCharge
- **Progression:** score → sessionXP, rank → operatorRank, powerUpPoints → scraps
- **Screen state:** GamePhase → ScreenType (CONSOLE → ConsoleScreen, etc.)
- **Cracks:** CrackCell → Crack, parentIds → originCrackId, childIds → branchCrackIds
- **Falling goop:** FallingBlock → LooseGoop, BlockData → GoopBlock, fallingBlocks → looseGoop
- **Commands:** MoveBoardCommand → SpinTankCommand, RotatePieceCommand → RotateGoopCommand

### Phase 24: UI & Documentation

**Goal**: Update user-facing text and documentation to use official terms
**Depends on**: Phase 23
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 24-01: UI Text Updates — completed 2026-01-27

**Details:**
- Updated HowToPlay.tsx: Hold Piece → Held Goop, Points → XP, Power Points → Scraps
- Updated Upgrades.tsx: POWER UPS → UPGRADES, Level → Rank
- Updated constants.ts: upgrade descriptions with corrected terminology

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- piece = falling polyomino (code), goop = settled substance (UI/user-facing)
- cell = grid position, block = cell content
- fast drop replaces soft drop terminology
- Tank terminology throughout (TankCell, tankRotation, tankPressure)
- Operator terminology for player (operatorRank, operatorXP)
- Scraps as upgrade currency (was powerUpPoints)
- Storage key v1 → v2 (intentional save reset for clean migration)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Inconsistent piece/goop terminology throughout codebase
- Vestigial "soft drop" name from removed hard drop mechanic
- Mixed grid/board/tank terminology
- score vs XP confusion
- powerUpPoints unclear naming (now "scraps")

**Issues Deferred:**

- None — all planned renames completed

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- None — this milestone specifically paid down terminology debt

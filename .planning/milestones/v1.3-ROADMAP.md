# Milestone v1.3: Shape Changes

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-26
**Phases:** 21
**Total Plans:** 3

## Overview

Extended game to 75 seconds with progressive piece sizes (Tetra → Penta → Hexa) based on elapsed time. 54 new polyomino pieces with corruption variants and mirroring support.

## Phases

### Phase 21: Piece Shapes

**Goal**: Implement new goop shapes beyond standard tetrominoes, review gravity calculation
**Depends on**: v1.2 complete
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 21-01: Timing + Types (timing constants, PieceType enum, zone thresholds)
- [x] 21-02: Piece Definitions (54 pieces from Minos.svg)
- [x] 21-03: Spawn Logic (zone-based selection, corruption, mirroring)

**Details:**

**Timing Changes:**
| Constant | Old | New | Rationale |
|----------|-----|-----|-----------|
| INITIAL_TIME_MS | 60000 | 75000 | 3 zones of 25 seconds each |
| INITIAL_SPEED | 800 | 780 | Slightly faster base fall |
| SOFT_DROP_FACTOR | 6 | 8 | Snappier fast drop |

**Piece Size Progression:**
| Zone | Time | Pieces |
|------|------|--------|
| Tetra | 0-25s | 10 pieces (5 normal + 5 corrupted) |
| Penta | 25-50s | 22 pieces (11 normal + 11 corrupted) |
| Hexa | 50-75s | 22 pieces (11 normal + 11 corrupted) |

**Spawn Mechanics:**
- 15% corruption chance per spawn (non-contiguous variants)
- 50% mirror chance for asymmetric pieces
- Zone transitions based on elapsed time / 3

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Keep original 7 tetromino values (I, J, L, O, S, T, Z) for backwards compatibility
- Used maxTime instead of INITIAL_TIME_MS for zone calculation (supports PRESSURE_CONTROL upgrade)
- Coordinates normalized around (0,0) for rotation support
- Normal pieces = contiguous (edge-touching), Corrupted = non-contiguous (corner-touching)

**Issues Resolved:**
- None - clean implementation

**Issues Deferred:**
- Gravity calculation review (not needed - existing system works with new pieces)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None

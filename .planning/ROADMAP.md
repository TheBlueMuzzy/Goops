- [[v1.3-ROADMAP|v1.3 Shape Changes]] — Phase 21 (shipped 2026-01-26)
- [[v1.4-ROADMAP|v1.4 Naming Standardization]] — Phases 22-24 (shipped 2026-01-27)
- ✅ **v1.5 Soft-Body Integration** — Phases 25-27.1 (shipped 2026-02-08)
- 🚧 **v1.6 Progressive Tutorial** — Phases 31-38 (in progress)

## Experimental Branch: Soft-Body Goop (SBG)

**Branch:** `soft-body-experiment`
**Status:** All prototypes complete, ready for integration planning
**Date:** 2026-01-28 to 2026-02-03

Research spike exploring soft-body physics for goop rendering. Built 5 prototypes testing different mechanics.

### Completed Prototypes

| Proto | Focus | Key Findings |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| 5b | Goo Filter | SVG feGaussianBlur + feColorMatrix = gold standard goo effect |
| 5c | Cell Walls | Inner cutout derived from outer vertices for consistent wobble |
| 6 | Fill/Pour | "Trim" approach - clip inner cutout to reveal fill from bottom |
| 7 | Merge | Dynamic blob generation, viscosity tuning, momentum transfer |
| 8 | Pop | Droplet particles, radial pressure, physics-based ready-to-pop pulse |
| 9 | Loose Goop | Support detection, cascade, corrupted shape splitting |

### Technical Findings

**Physics Parameters (Tuned Defaults):**
| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Damping | 0.97 | High, preserves momentum |
| Stiffness | 1 | Very low, loose springs |
| Pressure | 5 | Strong volume maintenance |
| Home Stiffness | 0.3 | Shape retention without rigidity |
| Return Speed | 0.5 | Moderate return speed |
| Viscosity | 2.5 | Honey-like feel for locked blobs |

**Key Algorithms:**
- Perimeter tracing for dynamic blob generation from grid cells
- BFS connectivity detection for corrupted shape splitting
- Radial spring pressure (vertex distance from center)
- Momentum dampening (30%) on merge to prevent implosion
- Blob collision only when at least one blob is moving

**Integration Considerations:**
- Rendering layer replacement (SVG paths → soft-body physics)
- Performance budget for mobile (current protos run well)
- State sync between game logic and visual physics
- Animation timing (fill, pop, fall, merge)

### 🚧 v1.6 Progressive Tutorial (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Build a progressive tutorial system with narrative-driven onboarding. Intercom transmissions teach mechanics through static-corrupted speech where key terms come through clearly. Multiple constrained training scenarios at rank 0 introduce mechanics one at a time. UI progressively reveals as the player ranks up.

**Narrative Foundation:** See PRD § Narrative Arc. The employer communicates via intercom (tutorial delivery). The veteran character hijacks the radio (upgrade delivery, future milestone). The operator keeps a journal (? button, player reference).

#### Phase 31: Tutorial Infrastructure

**Goal**: Intercom text system (static rendering with clear keywords), TutorialOverlay component, event bus hooks for tutorial triggers, tutorial state machine + localStorage persistence
**Depends on**: v1.5 complete
**Research**: Unlikely (internal patterns)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [x] 31-01: Tutorial state machine, SaveData persistence, event bus hooks
- [x] 31-02: Intercom text rendering (garble renderer + typewriter display)
- [x] 31-03: TutorialOverlay & Game.tsx integration

#### Phase 32: Journal System

**Goal**: The ? button becomes a living "Operator Journal" — records learned mechanics from intercom transmissions. Pages unlock as player progresses. Replaces static HowToPlay
**Depends on**: Phase 31
**Research**: Unlikely (internal patterns)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [x] 32-01: Journal data layer & OperatorJournal component

#### Phase 33: Rank 0 Training Sequence

**Goal**: Multiple constrained training scenarios (0TA through 0T?) with intercom-guided progression. Each teaches one concept: rotation, dropping, crack sealing, pop timing tension (scaffolding vs pressure), cylindrical wrapping, first real shift. As many levels as needed to prove out core mechanics before rank 1
**Depends on**: Phase 32 (journal records what's learned)
**Research**: Unlikely (gameplay constraints, needs design iteration)
**Plans**: 4

Plans:
- [x] 33-01: Training scenario data model & configs
- [x] 33-02: GameEngine training mode & flow controller
- [ ] 33-03: Intercom scripts & journal content
- [ ] 33-04: Training HUD, highlight system & verification

#### Phase 34: Rank-Gated UI

**Goal**: Console panels, complication indicators, upgrade slots, ability circles — hidden until their unlock rank. Console elements glow to guide player when new things appear
**Depends on**: Phase 31 (tutorial state drives visibility)
**Research**: Unlikely (conditional rendering)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 34-01: TBD

#### Phase 35: Complication Introductions

**Goal**: Intercom warnings when LIGHTS (rank 2), LASER (rank 4), CONTROLS (rank 6) first fire. Non-blocking during gameplay. Mini-game first-time walkthrough with HUD element teaching
**Depends on**: Phase 34 (rank-gated UI reveals complication panels)
**Research**: Unlikely (reuses Phase 31 overlay)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 35-01: TBD

#### Phase 36: Upgrade & Progression Onboarding

**Goal**: First upgrade spotlight, active ability explanation, scraps introduction. Infrastructure for the veteran's radio hijack system (content TBD, delivery system built)
**Depends on**: Phase 35
**Research**: Unlikely (internal patterns)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 36-01: TBD

#### Phase 37: Post-10 Progressive Hints

**Goal**: Rank-up narrative beat infrastructure. New colors (Purple@10, White@30), multi-color pieces@20, wild goop@40 — intercom + journal entries at each unlock rank. Extensible system for full 0-50 story arc
**Depends on**: Phase 36
**Research**: Unlikely (reuses overlay + journal)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 37-01: TBD

#### Phase 38: Returning Player, Polish & Testing

**Goal**: Rank-based competence inference (rank 10+ = skip basics), handle localStorage clears, "How to Play" replay in settings, skip button, edge cases (multi-rank jumps), mobile performance, test coverage
**Depends on**: Phase 37
**Research**: Unlikely (internal logic)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 38-01: TBD

## Experimental Branch: Soft-Body Goop (SBG)

**Branch:** `soft-body-experiment`
**Status:** All prototypes complete, ready for integration planning
**Date:** 2026-01-28 to 2026-02-03

Research spike exploring soft-body physics for goop rendering. Built 5 prototypes testing different mechanics.

### Completed Prototypes

| Proto | Focus | Key Findings |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| 5b | Goo Filter | SVG feGaussianBlur + feColorMatrix = gold standard goo effect |
| 5c | Cell Walls | Inner cutout derived from outer vertices for consistent wobble |
| 6 | Fill/Pour | "Trim" approach - clip inner cutout to reveal fill from bottom |
| 7 | Merge | Dynamic blob generation, viscosity tuning, momentum transfer |
| 8 | Pop | Droplet particles, radial pressure, physics-based ready-to-pop pulse |
| 9 | Loose Goop | Support detection, cascade, corrupted shape splitting |

### Technical Findings

**Physics Parameters (Tuned Defaults):**
| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Damping | 0.97 | High, preserves momentum |
| Stiffness | 1 | Very low, loose springs |
| Pressure | 5 | Strong volume maintenance |
| Home Stiffness | 0.3 | Shape retention without rigidity |
| Return Speed | 0.5 | Moderate return speed |
| Viscosity | 2.5 | Honey-like feel for locked blobs |

**Key Algorithms:**
- Perimeter tracing for dynamic blob generation from grid cells
- BFS connectivity detection for corrupted shape splitting
- Radial spring pressure (vertex distance from center)
- Momentum dampening (30%) on merge to prevent implosion
- Blob collision only when at least one blob is moving

**Integration Considerations:**
- Rendering layer replacement (SVG paths → soft-body physics)
- Performance budget for mobile (current protos run well)
- State sync between game logic and visual physics
- Animation timing (fill, pop, fall, merge)

### 🚧 v1.5 Soft-Body Integration (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Port soft-body physics visuals from prototypes into main game rendering, replacing static grid cells with deformable, gooey blobs.

#### Phase 25: Physics Foundation

**Goal**: Port Verlet physics engine and adapt to game coordinate system
**Depends on**: Prototype research complete
**Research**: Likely (cylindrical projection implications)
**Research topics**: How to apply cylindrical transform to physics vertices, or whether to flatten rendering
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [x] 25-01: Physics types and Verlet engine (completed 2026-02-03)
- [x] 25-02: Blob factory and integration hook (completed 2026-02-03)

#### Phase 26: Perimeter & Blob System

**Goal**: Replace goopGroupId rect rendering with perimeter-traced soft-body blobs
**Depends on**: Phase 25
**Research**: No (perimeter tracing already ported in Phase 25, goo filter from Proto-7)
**Plans**: 3

Plans:
- [x] 26-01: Goo filter & physics integration (completed 2026-02-03)
- [ ] 26-02: Soft-body blob rendering (PAUSED - blocked by coordinate mismatch)
- [ ] 26-03: Fill animation & rendering cutover

#### Phase 26.1: Flatten Coordinate System (INSERTED)

**Goal**: Remove cylindrical projection, use flat 2D coordinates for all rendering
**Depends on**: Phase 26-01 complete
**Research**: No
**Rationale**: Cylindrical projection (`visXToScreenX`) causes constant coordinate mismatches between game rendering and soft-body physics. Removing it simplifies integration significantly. The curved visual effect can be re-added later via WebGL shader if desired.
**Plans**: 1

Plans:
- [x] 26.1-01: Remove cylindrical projection, flatten coordinate system (completed 2026-02-03)
- [x] 26.1-02: Add cylindrical wrapping to SBG physics (completed 2026-02-04)
- [x] 26.1-03: Seam wrapping visual merge (completed 2026-02-04)

**Context from implementation session:**
- Physics runs in flat pixel space (PHYSICS_GRID_OFFSET + PHYSICS_CELL_SIZE)
- Game SVG uses cylindrical projection (VIEWBOX centered at 0, sin() transform for X)
- Blobs created at x=200+ are outside viewBox range (-115 to +115)
- Every rendering path requires coordinate transforms, causing ongoing integration friction

#### Phase 27: Active Piece Physics

**Goal**: Falling pieces use soft-body physics (snappy, no viscosity)
**Depends on**: Phase 26.1
**Research**: No (Proto-7 solved falling piece physics)
**Plans**: 2

Plans:
- [x] 27-01: Active piece blob lifecycle (completed 2026-02-05)
- [ ] 27-02: Rendering switch

#### Phase 28: Locked Goop Behavior

**Goal**: Viscosity, fill animation, ready-to-pop impulse, attraction springs
**Depends on**: Phase 27
**Research**: Unlikely (Protos 6-8 have all mechanics)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 28-01: TBD

#### Phase 29: Pop & Cascade

**Goal**: Pop effects with droplets, support detection, loose goop, corrupted splitting
**Depends on**: Phase 28
**Research**: Unlikely (Protos 8-9 have all mechanics)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 29-01: TBD

#### Phase 30: Polish & Performance

**Goal**: Mobile optimization, parameter tuning, edge case handling
**Depends on**: Phase 29
**Research**: Likely (mobile profiling, edge cases with dump pieces/wild goop/cracks)
**Research topics**: React performance profiling, requestAnimationFrame timing, mobile throttling
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 30-01: TBD

# UAT Issues: Phase 26.1 (Proto-9 Parity)

**Tested:** 2026-02-04
**Source:** .planning/STATE.md (Proto-9 parity session work)
**Tester:** User via /gsd:verify-work

## Open Issues

### UAT-001: Goop still feels too stiff

**Discovered:** 2026-02-04
**Phase/Plan:** 26.1 (Proto-9 parity work)
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** Soft-body physics feel
**Description:** Despite homeStiffness being set to 0.01 (matching Proto-9), blobs feel too rigid and don't wobble like Proto-9.
**Expected:** Blobs should feel loose and gooey, similar to Proto-9's jiggly, soft feel.
**Actual:** Blobs feel stiff and rigid, not matching Proto-9's behavior even with same slider values.
**Repro:** Lock any goop and observe wobble compared to Proto-9 (http://localhost:5173/GOOPS/?proto=9)

### UAT-002: Blob collision hard to observe due to stiffness

**Discovered:** 2026-02-04
**Phase/Plan:** 26.1 (Proto-9 parity work)
**Severity:** Minor
**Feature:** Blob collision (different colors)
**Description:** Collision logic appears to work (different colors don't merge), but the "smoosh" effect isn't visible because blobs are too stiff.
**Expected:** Different-colored blobs should visibly push against each other with soft deformation.
**Actual:** Colors stay separate (correct) but don't show dynamic collision response due to stiffness.
**Repro:** Lock different colored goop adjacent to each other.

### UAT-004: Debug sliders don't produce Proto-9 matching results

**Discovered:** 2026-02-04
**Phase/Plan:** 26.1 (Proto-9 parity work)
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** Debug panel parameter tuning
**Description:** Setting sliders to same values as Proto-9 doesn't produce the same look and feel. Possible disconnection between UI and physics, or scaling issues.
**Expected:** Matching slider values should produce matching visual behavior between game and Proto-9.
**Actual:** Same values produce different results - physics feel different.
**Repro:**
1. Open Proto-9: http://localhost:5173/GOOPS/?proto=9
2. Note slider values
3. Set same values in game debug panel (press `)
4. Compare behavior

## Resolved Issues

### UAT-003: Droplets incorrectly spawn on merge

**Discovered:** 2026-02-04
**Resolved:** 2026-02-04 - Fixed in 26.1-FIX.md Task 3
**Commit:** 2d1a499
**Description:** Droplets no longer spawn on merge - only on actual pop events.

### UAT-005: Droplet size slider not connected

**Discovered:** 2026-02-04
**Resolved:** 2026-02-04 - Fixed in 26.1-FIX audit fixes
**Commit:** 0b56b56
**Description:** Added droplet params to useEffect dependency array. Sliders now work.

### UAT-006: Loose goop falls too fast (near instant)

**Discovered:** 2026-02-04
**Resolved:** 2026-02-04 - Fixed in 26.1-FIX audit fixes
**Commit:** 0b56b56
**Description:** Implemented soft-body blob sync with looseGoop state, tuned fall speed to be slightly faster than fast-drop.

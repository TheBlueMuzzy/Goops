# Project State

## Current Position

Phase: 33 of 38 (Rank 0 Training Sequence)
Plan: 33-05 in progress (Engine Prerequisites) → 33-06, 33-07 remaining
Status: Tutorial v3 — walkthrough approved (14 steps), Plan 33-05 Task 1+2 coded
Last activity: 2026-02-20 — Plan 33-05 implemented (two-step sealing + CRACK_OFFSCREEN)

Progress: █████████░ 93%

## Branch Workflow (SOP)

**Standard procedure:** All new work happens on feature branches, not master.
- `master` = stable, tested code only
- Feature branches = work in progress
- Merge to master only after human verification passes

**Active feature branches:**
- `feature/tutorial-infrastructure` (Phase 31 complete, Phase 32 complete, Phase 33 in progress)

## Tutorial v3 Rewrite (2026-02-19)

### Why Rewrite
Tutorial v2 had persistent bugs through 11 UAT rounds. Root cause: fragile architecture with 20+ refs, 10+ pause/unpause locations, and custom handlers embedded in a 1400-line effect chain. Small changes caused destructive regressions. A clean rewrite with proper architecture is faster than continued patching.

### Design Document
**Source of truth:** `.planning/Tutorial3.md`
- Full audit of v2 (every step, every pattern, every coupling point)
- All designer questions answered and confirmed
- 14 steps across 6 phases (E1_SEAL_CRACK removed, E2 reworked as discovery trigger)
- Architecture direction: state machine, handler registry, timeout pool

### Key Decisions Confirmed
| Decision | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Architecture | State machine pattern (ENTERING → WAITING → MESSAGE_VISIBLE → ARMED → ADVANCING) |
| Step count | 14 steps, 6 phases (A:1, B:4, C:4, D:3, E:1, F:1) |
| E-phase | E2 eliminated, absorbed into E1 via standard hint pattern. E3→E2 renumbered. |
| Crack sealing | Two-step: plug on lock, seal on pop (engine prerequisite — current behavior is buggy) |
| D3 trigger | CRACK_OFFSCREEN event (replaces 200ms polling) |
| D2 retry | Accumulate cracks (never remove old ones) instead of pop-all reset |
| F1 exit | Console screen, rank 0→1 (no end screen). Replays don't affect rank. |
| Config editing | All timings/colors/pause states as named config fields, easy to change |
| Garble system | Keep exactly as-is |
| Future tutorials | Same system reused at higher ranks for new concepts |

### GSD Plans (Approved — committed b99ed73)
```
Plan 33-05: Engine Prerequisites (2 tasks)
  1. Two-step crack sealing (plug on lock, seal on pop, glow indicator)
  2. CRACK_OFFSCREEN event (fires when arrow first appears)

Plan 33-06: Tutorial Framework + Step Configs (2 tasks)
  1. State machine framework (lifecycle states, timeout pool, handler registry, types)
  2. Step configs (15 steps) + messages + standard handler implementations

Plan 33-07: Custom Handlers + Integration + UAT (2 tasks + 1 checkpoint)
  1. Custom handlers (D2 retry, D3 discovery, E1 seal+pop, F1 freeplay)
  2. Wire into Game.tsx, GameBoard, TutorialOverlay, remove old code
  3. Full A1→F1 playthrough verification
```

### Uncommitted Changes (from v2 UAT round 11)
- `hooks/useTrainingFlow.ts` — v2 code (will be replaced by v3 rewrite)
- `data/trainingScenarios.ts` — v2 step configs (will be replaced)
- `core/GameEngine.ts` — Debug logging from v2 (will be cleaned up)

### Next Steps
1. **Step-by-step walkthrough** — Claude presents each of the 15 steps, user approves or corrects
2. Execute Plan 33-05: Engine prerequisites (crack sealing + CRACK_OFFSCREEN)
3. Execute Plan 33-06: Framework + step configs
4. Execute Plan 33-07: Custom handlers + integration + UAT

## Prior Work (v2 — for reference)

<details>
<summary>Tutorial v2 History (UAT rounds 1-11)</summary>

### What v2 Built (2026-02-15)
- 16 steps (A:1, B:4, C:4, D:3, E:3, F:1), 6 phases
- All new step IDs, messages, and scenario configs
- 6 features: continuousSpawn, pressureCap, periodicCrackInterval, autoSkipMs, persistent D3 discovery, F1 ending states
- Pop-lowers-pressure, F1 graduation + overflow endings

### UAT Rounds Summary
- **Rounds 1-6**: Basic flow fixes, rendering, progression bugs
- **Rounds 7-8**: Message stability, E-phase split, pressure cap
- **Rounds 9-10**: E-phase redesign, F1 soft crash, message flash fixes
- **Round 11**: E1 GOAL_CAPTURED not firing (2 root causes found, fixes applied but untested)

### Architecture Problems Identified
- 1400-line useTrainingFlow.ts with 20+ refs
- Pause/unpause in 10+ scattered locations
- 4 steps with 200+ lines of custom code embedded in main effect
- Deferred timeouts requiring generation counter pattern
- D3 discovery crossing step boundaries via intentionally un-cleaned ref
- trainingPopLowersPressure set but never read by engine

</details>

## Known Issues

- PiecePreview NEXT/HOLD labels at 18px may be too large for 48px box
- Some SVG text in Art.tsx not yet standardized
- **Fill rendering "almost hole" inversion**: fillRule="evenodd" issue with near-touching vertices
- **Crack sealing mechanic is wrong**: Cracks disappear on piece lock instead of requiring pop to seal (documented in Tutorial3.md as engine prerequisite)

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-19
**Version:** 1.1.13
**Branch:** feature/tutorial-infrastructure
**Build:** 307 (untested — v2 round 11 fixes)

### Resume Command
```
Phase 33 — Tutorial v3 Rewrite

Design complete. Plans approved and committed.

WHAT TO DO:
1. Read .planning/Tutorial3.md (Section 5: Step Spec)
2. Walk through all 15 steps with user — present what each step does, user approves/corrects
3. After walkthrough approved, execute plans 33-05 → 33-06 → 33-07
```

# Project State

## Branch Workflow (SOP)

**Standard procedure:** All new work happens on feature branches, not master.
- `master` = stable, tested code only
- Feature branches = work in progress
- Merge to master only after human verification passes

**Active feature branches:**
- None — v1.2 complete, ready for bug fix work

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-24)

**Core value:** The game feels satisfying to play on mobile - responsive controls, smooth animations, no input lag.
**Current focus:** v1.2 shipped — bug fixes and testing before next milestone

## Current Position

Phase: 18 of 18 (all complete)
Plan: All plans complete
Status: v1.2 SHIPPED
Last activity: 2026-01-24 — v1.2 milestone archived

Progress: ████████████████████ 49/49 plans (v1.0 + v1.1 + v1.2 complete)

## What's Done

### v1.2 Progression System (Shipped 2026-01-24)

Full ranks 0-39 progression with 4 bands, 20 upgrades, and 3 new colors.

Key features:
- 20 upgrades across passive/active/feature types
- Active ability system with per-ability charge times
- Lights malfunction rework (player-controlled brightness)
- Expanding cracks mechanic
- 3 new colors: Orange@10, Purple@20, White@30

See [v1.2-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md) for full details.

### v1.1 Architecture Refactor (Shipped 2026-01-21)

All 6 phases (8-13) complete. See [v1.1-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md) for full details.

### v1.0 MVP (Shipped 2026-01-21)

All 7 phases complete. See [v1.0-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md) for full details.

## Accumulated Context

### Balance Summary (Current v1.2.0)

| Complication | Trigger | Player Mitigation |
|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| Laser | Capacitor drains on pop | +10% refill on piece lock |
| Controls | Heat builds on rotate | Heat dissipates when idle |
| Lights | Brightness dims when not soft dropping | Soft drop to recharge |

All three complications have player-driven triggers AND mitigations.

### Active Abilities (v1.2.0)

| Active | Charge Time | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Cooldown Booster | 20s | +25% cooldown | +35% | +50% |
| Goop Dump | 15s | 1 wave (18 pcs) | 2 waves | 3 waves |
| Goop Colorizer | 25s | 6 match | 7 match | 8 match |
| Crack Down | 30s | 3 cracks low | 5 cracks | 7 cracks |

## Known Issues (Post v1.2)

**RESEARCH REQUIRED - Tetris Movement Feel:**
1. **Lock delay / last-moment sliding** - Research how Tetris achieves this feel.
2. **Sideways movement into gaps** - Research Tetris collision logic for moving into gaps.

⚠️ **WARNING for tasks 1-2:** Previous attempts "broke pretty badly". Approach with caution.

**Fixed:**
- Gravity pieces now interact with cracks (v1.1.27)
- Non-matching color pieces no longer destroy cracks (they persist under goop)

**Investigated (see INVESTIGATIONS.md):**
- Pressure not rising bug — likely fixed in v1.1, cannot reproduce

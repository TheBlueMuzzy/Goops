# Project State

## Branch Workflow (SOP)

**Standard procedure:** All new work happens on feature branches, not master.
- `master` = stable, tested code only
- Feature branches = work in progress
- Merge to master only after human verification passes

**Active feature branches:**
- None — v1.2 complete, ready for bug fix work

## Next Steps

**Ready to start:** v1.3 milestone (GoopPieceRework - different piece shapes)
**No bugs or blockers.**

Options:
1. `/gsd:new-milestone` — Define phases for v1.3
2. Test current build at https://thebluemuzzy.github.io/GOOPS/
3. Something else — just tell Claude what you want

## Project Reference

See: [[PROJECT]] (updated 2026-01-24)

**Core value:** The game feels satisfying to play on mobile - responsive controls, smooth animations, no input lag.
**Current focus:** v1.2 shipped — bug fixes and testing before next milestone

## Current Position

Phase: 20 (Expanding Cracks Overhaul)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-01-24 — Completed 20-01-PLAN.md

Progress: █████████████████████ 53/53 plans

## What's Done

### v1.2 Progression System (Shipped 2026-01-24)

Full ranks 0-39 progression with 4 bands, 20 upgrades, and 3 new colors.

Key features:
- 20 upgrades across passive/active/feature types
- Active ability system with per-ability charge times
- Lights malfunction rework (player-controlled brightness)
- Expanding cracks mechanic
- 3 new colors: Orange@10, Purple@20, White@30

See [[v1.2-ROADMAP]] for full details.

### v1.1 Architecture Refactor (Shipped 2026-01-21)

All 6 phases (8-13) complete. See [[v1.1-ROADMAP]] for full details.

### v1.0 MVP (Shipped 2026-01-21)

All 7 phases complete. See [[v1.0-ROADMAP]] for full details.

## Accumulated Context

### Balance Summary (Current v1.2.0)

| Complication | Trigger | Player Mitigation |
|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| Laser | Capacitor drains on pop | +10% refill on piece lock |
| Controls | Heat builds on rotate | Heat dissipates when idle |
| Lights | Brightness dims when not soft dropping | Soft drop to recharge |

All three complications have player-driven triggers AND mitigations.

### Active Abilities (v1.2.0)

| Active | Charge Time | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Cooldown Booster | 20s | +25% cooldown | +35% | +50% |
| Goop Dump | 15s | 1 wave (18 pcs) | 2 waves | 3 waves |
| Goop Colorizer | 25s | 6 match | 7 match | 8 match |
| Crack Down | 30s | 3 cracks low | 5 cracks | 7 cracks |

## Known Issues

**Bugs:**
- Pressure not rising bug — debug logging added, waiting for next occurrence

**Tech Debt:**
- `GameEngine.ts` at 1374 lines — consider extracting CrackManager if it grows more
- Console.log placeholders in `ConsoleView.tsx:253-255` — minor cleanup when convenient

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-25
**Version:** 1.1.13
**Branch:** master

### This Session Summary (2026-01-25)

**Consolidated Known Issues tracking**

1. **Deleted CONCERNS.md** — was stale and not maintained
   - Verified each concern against codebase
   - "Minigame UI incomplete" was FALSE (fully functional)
   - "Console.log placeholders" minor, moved to tech debt

2. **Updated STATE.md Known Issues section**
   - Now tracks: bugs + tech debt
   - Cleaned out fixed/completed items
   - Single source of truth for `<clear>` to check

3. **Updated CLAUDE.md `<clear>` protocol**
   - Now explicitly checks "Known Issues" section
   - Updated GameEngine line count (1177 → 1374)

**Previous Session (SOP & Workflow Overhaul)**

1. **Distance penalty increased to 25%** (v1.1.46)
   - `core/GameEngine.ts:1198` — changed from 0.15 to 0.25
   - Cracks now limited to ~3 cells instead of ~4-6

2. **Ghost piece visibility improved** (v1.1.46-48)
   - Added transparent color fill (20% opacity) behind dashed outline
   - Fixed: `getContourPath` creates disconnected lines (unfillable), switched to `<rect>`
   - Outline opacity increased to 75%
   - Helps distinguish orange vs red, and split-color pieces

3. **O piece rotation fixed for split-colors** (v1.1.49-50)
   - Previously skipped rotation entirely (optimization for single-color)
   - v1.1.49: Enabled rotation but piece jumped (rotated around 0,0)
   - v1.1.50: Fixed — rotates `cellColors` array instead of cell positions
   - Shape stays in place, colors rotate visually around center

4. **XP curve flattened** (v1.1.51)
   - Old: `(rank+2) * (1750 + 250*rank)` — ~7M to rank 40
   - New: `3500 + (rank * 250)` per rank — ~336K to rank 40
   - Much more achievable progression

**Future ideas captured:**
- `SlowMode` concept in [[PROJECT]] (pressure from goop volume, crack-based leveling)
- `GoopPieceRework` branch created for next milestone (different goop shapes)

**Next session:** Start GoopPieceRework milestone — different piece shapes to facilitate faster stacking

**All deployed to:** https://thebluemuzzy.github.io/GOOPS/

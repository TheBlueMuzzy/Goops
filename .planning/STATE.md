# Project State

## Branch Workflow (SOP)

**Standard procedure:** All new work happens on feature branches, not master.
- `master` = stable, tested code only
- Feature branches = work in progress
- Merge to master only after human verification passes

**Active feature branches:**
- None — all work complete on master

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-19)

**Core value:** The game feels satisfying to play on mobile - responsive controls, smooth animations, no input lag.
**Current focus:** Phase 7 planned - Ready to execute 07-01

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 7 (System Upgrades) - IN PROGRESS
Plan: 1 of 4 complete

- SVG coordinate conversion working (uses hidden reference element)
- Snap to 4 corners (45°, 135°, 225°, 315°) on release
- Debug code cleaned up
- Works on both PC and mobile

### Phase 2: Minigame Logic - COMPLETE
- Reset Laser minigame logic complete (02-01)
  - Bug fixes (2026-01-19): both lights ON for center target, sliders start in wrong positions

  - Redesigned from Lights Out toggle → sequence memory puzzle
  - Flow: slider → watch 4-button sequence → repeat → slider
  - Guaranteed 6 interactions per solve
- Reset Controls minigame logic complete (02-03)
  - Dial alignment puzzle: align to 4 random corners in sequence
  - Drag to rotate, release to snap, tap to confirm
  - Press animation (translate down) on confirm tap
  - Visual feedback: corner lights, PRESS text, shake on wrong press
  - Proper drag vs tap separation

### Phase 3: Complications - COMPLETE
- 03-01: Complication Types & Triggers
  - ComplicationType enum: LIGHTS, CONTROLS, LASER

  - New linear delta curve: `(rank-1) * (1000 + 250*rank)`
  - Rank 2: 1,500 XP (was 5,000) — much smoother tutorial
  - Rank 10: 31,500 XP | Rank 100: 2,574,000 XP
  - XP floor: `max(100 * rank, score)` prevents zero-gain runs
- 06-02: Milestone Infrastructure - COMPLETE
  - Milestones at ranks 10, 20, 30... 100
  - `getMilestoneRanks()`, `getNextMilestone()`, `getMilestonesInRange()` helpers

  - Upgrade count text centered in button

## Approved Complication Specifications

| Complication | Trigger | Effect | Rank |
|--------------|---------|--------|------|
| LASER | Capacitor drains to 0 (4 per unit popped) | Two-tap mechanic (prime then pop) | 1+ |
| LIGHTS | 50% on piece lock when pressure gap >= 3-5 rows | 10% brightness + grayscale over 1.5s | 2+ |
| CONTROLS | Heat meter reaches 100 (+5 per rotation) | 2 inputs per move, half hold speed | 3+ |

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 18 (across 6 phases)
- Total tests: 64 (28 progression, 6 coordinates, 30 game logic)
- Average duration: ~30 min per plan (including bug fixes)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Phase 1: Rotation works anywhere on dial (edge-only approach not needed)
- SVG coordinate conversion requires hidden reference element due to preserveAspectRatio
- No CSS transition on dial snap (causes fly-away visual bug)
- Use refs instead of state for values needed in event handler closures
- Reset Lights: Sequence memory over Lights Out toggle (toggle had null space, 1-press solutions)
- Reset Controls: 15° tolerance for dial alignment, 4 corner sequence
- Reset Controls: Corner angles are 45°=TR, 315°=TL, 225°=BL, 135°=BR
- LIGHTS effect: CSS filter on SVG instead of overlay (keeps alert visible)
- CONTROLS effect: Double-tap + half speed instead of flip toggle
- Complication unlocks based on starting rank, not mid-run rank
- HUD meters only visible when complication can trigger (rank-gated)

**Rank Band System (Jan 2026):**
- Ranks organized into bands of 10 (Tutorial 0-9, Band 1 10-19, etc.)
- First 5 ranks of each band (X0-X4): introduce and ramp new mechanic
- Last 5 ranks of each band (X5-X9): consolidation, no new mechanics
- Tutorial band (0-9): Complications only, gentler XP curve
- Band 1 (10-19): Starting junk + Teal color
- Band 2 (20-29): Multi-color pieces + new color
- Band 3 (30-39): Growing cracks + new color
- Colors cap at 10 total (no new colors after ~rank 60)
- Upgrades can be spent at any rank, not locked to bands
- Focus for now: ranks 0-20

### Key Technical Discovery

**SVG Coordinate Conversion with preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid slice"**

Simple viewBox math doesn't work. Must use:
```tsx
const refPoint = document.getElementById('coord-reference'); // Outside rotating groups!
const ctm = refPoint.getScreenCTM();
const svgPoint = screenPoint.matrixTransform(ctm.inverse());
```

**Stale Closure Fix for Event Handlers**

When using useEffect to register global event listeners, state values captured in closures become stale. Use refs for values that need to be current:
```tsx
const currentRotationRef = useRef(0);
// In move handler: currentRotationRef.current = newRotation;
// In end handler: use currentRotationRef.current, not state
```

**CSS Transform vs SVG Transform Conflict**

CSS animations with `transform` override inline SVG `transform` attributes. To apply shake animation to a rotating element, use nested groups:
```tsx
<g transform={`rotate(${rotation} ...)`}>  {/* Outer: rotation */}
    <g className={shaking ? 'shake' : ''}>   {/* Inner: shake animation */}
        {/* content */}
    </g>
</g>
```

**CSS Filter for Selective Dimming**

Apply filter to game content only, keeping alerts exempt:
```tsx
<svg className={lightsDimmed ? 'lights-dimmed' : ''}>
// .lights-dimmed { animation: lightsDimIn 1.5s ease-out forwards; }
// @keyframes lightsDimIn { to { filter: brightness(0.1) grayscale(1); } }
```

### Deferred Issues

- Rank 10: JUNK_UNIFORMITY passive (Band 1)
- Rank 15: GOOPER active (drops same-color junk)
- Rank 20: ACTIVE_SLOT_2 passive (equip 2 actives)
- Active abilities charge via crack-goop pops (glowing units)
- Active HUD buttons go on right side of periscope, below heat meter

**Infrastructure added:**

# Project State

## Current Position

Phase: 33 of 38 (Rank 0 Training Sequence)
Plan: 4 of 4 in current phase — FIX-R5 plan created, fixes coded (uncommitted), ready to commit and verify
Status: In progress — A & B approved, C1/C1B/C1C approved, C2+ through F need UAT after R5 fixes
Last activity: 2026-02-12 - Round 5 fixes: C2 tap advance, C3B step, pressure tuning, fill timestamp adjustment

Progress: █████░░░░░ 50%

## Branch Workflow (SOP)

**Standard procedure:** All new work happens on feature branches, not master.
- `master` = stable, tested code only
- Feature branches = work in progress
- Merge to master only after human verification passes

**Active feature branches:**
- `feature/tutorial-infrastructure` (Phase 31 complete, Phase 32 complete, Phase 33 in progress)

## Next Steps

33-04-FIX-R5 plan created for 3 round-5 UAT issues. Fixes already coded (uncommitted).

**Round 5 fixes (uncommitted, ready to commit):**
- UAT-011 (Blocker): C2 changed from event-based to tap advance — merge fires during pauseDelay
- UAT-010 (Major): Added C3B_POP_HINT step bridging C3→D1 gap
- UAT-012 (Minor): Pressure rates bumped 0.2→0.3125 (C2/C3), 0.3→0.46875 (D/E)
- Bonus: fill timestamp adjustment, showOnInput, reshowAfterMs, D1 pauseDelay

**UAT approval status:**
- A-phase (A1, A2): APPROVED
- B-phase (B1, B1B, B2, B3, B4): APPROVED
- C-phase (C1, C1B, C1C, C2, C3, C3B): APPROVED
- D-phase (D1, D2, D3): NEEDS TESTING
- E-phase (E1): NEEDS TESTING
- F-phase (F1, F2): NEEDS TESTING

After full verification: create 33-04-FIX-SUMMARY, update ROADMAP, metadata commit.

### Key Technical Changes This Session

**PieceSpawn Refactor (types/training.ts, useTrainingFlow.ts)**
- Replaced `size: number` with `shape: GoopShape` + optional `rotation: number`
- Spawn logic now finds actual shape templates from TETRA_NORMAL/PENTA_NORMAL/HEXA_NORMAL
- Applies rotation via `getRotatedCells()` for initial orientation
- B1: blue T_I horizontal (rotation:1), B3: yellow T_T, B4: blue T_O (2x2), D2: green T_O

**Per-Blob Shake (GameBoard.tsx)**
- Removed per-color-group shake (was shaking ALL blobs of same color)
- Added `isBlobShaking = blob.id === shakingGroupId` check on each blob's `<g>` in both goo-filter and cutout sections
- Each blob shakes independently when rejected

**Training Input Gating (useInputHandlers.ts, GameBoard.tsx, Game.tsx)**
- `disableSwap`: Skips hold interval entirely (no radial graphic, no swap event)
- `disablePop`: All goop taps trigger shake+rejection when `AllowedControls.pop===false`
- `trainingHighlightColor`: Wrong-color taps trigger shake+rejection
- All three passed as props: Game.tsx → GameBoard → useInputHandlers

**Pressure Color Filter (useTrainingFlow.ts, types/training.ts)**
- New `advancePressureAboveColor` StepSetup field
- When set, pressure-above-pieces poll only checks cells of that color
- C1B uses `COLORS.YELLOW` — triggers when pressure covers yellow T, not all blues

**Highlight System (GameEngine.ts, useTrainingFlow.ts, GameBoard.tsx, actions.ts)**
- `trainingHighlightColor` on GameEngine + returned from useTrainingFlow
- CSS `training-pulse` animation: scale 1→1.06 with `transform-box: fill-box`
- Pop color restriction in PopGoopCommand: rejects pops of non-matching color
- C1C highlights YELLOW (pop yellow → C2 shows blue merge + solidify timing)

**B-Phase Single-Fall Flow (trainingScenarios.ts)**
- All 3 messages during SAME first piece fall: B1 (goop intro) → B1B at 25% → B2 at 40%
- B2: no separate piece spawn, no reshow, pauseGame:false, fast-drop enabled mid-fall
- B4_PRACTICE: new step after B3, spawns blue 2x2, "Practice what you've learned"
- 16 total steps across 6 phases

### Decisions Made

- Typography: 18px minimum body, CSS classes with !important, full project sweep
- Journal layout: accordion (single column) over sidebar+content (two column)
- TEXT_MANIFEST.md as editable text source-of-truth
- Garble system: bracket notation, no partial corruption
- Training mode: pendingTrainingPalette interception, tick gates, freezeFalling
- Advance arming prevents dismiss-tap from triggering advance
- B2 keywords: "down" and "press" are white, not green
- C-phase: pop yellow (not blue) → demonstrates merge + solidify timing with blue-on-blue

### Pipeline Architecture Session (2026-02-10)

**Goal:** Design a "Lossless Pipeline" integrating BMUZ + GSD + Agent Teams.

**Installed:**
- Agent Teams feature flag enabled globally (~/.claude/settings.json)
- `/build-with-agent-team` skill installed (~/.claude/skills/build-with-agent-team/)

**Architecture Explored (4-Agent Team):**
- Lead (user handler), Scribe (docs), Builder (code), Researcher (eyes)
- Scribe updates STATE/ROADMAP/SUMMARY/PRD/CLAUDE.md/memory in real-time
- Researcher uses Playground (design exploration) + Playwright (automated testing)
- Wrapper skill reads GSD PLAN.md and orchestrates AT team

**Critical Concerns Identified:**
- Token cost: 4 agents = 3-5x cost per session (too expensive for small tasks)
- AT is experimental (no session resume, known bugs, could change)
- Lead context bloat from message relaying (not actually "lean")
- GSD plans are sequential — parallel agents don't add speed
- Non-coders can't debug team coordination failures

**Revised Direction:**
- Enhanced single-agent with smart automation as default
- Agent Teams as opt-in power mode for big plans only
- Better hooks for auto-saving STATE.md (solve context loss without AT)
- Playground for non-CLI visual interaction (JSON config files)
- Subagents for parallel research (already works, no AT needed)

**User's Core Needs (refined):**
1. Low cost
2. Lossless memory + vision capture
3. Project manager that doesn't fall out of GSD loop
4. Simple, covers non-coder mistakes
5. End-to-end with flexible entry points
6. Parallel research + documentation
7. Non-CLI interaction methods

**Status:** Designing final architecture. No code built yet for pipeline skill.

### Known Issues

- PiecePreview NEXT/HOLD labels at 18px may be too large for 48px box
- Some SVG text in Art.tsx not yet standardized
- Per-step crack spawning not yet active

### Roadmap Evolution

- Milestone v1.5 shipped: Soft-body goop rendering, 4 completed phases (2026-02-08)
- Milestone v1.6 created: Progressive Tutorial, 8 phases (Phase 31-38)

Round 5 fixes CODED but uncommitted (8 files, 175 insertions).
A & B approved. C1/C1B/C1C approved. C2+ through F need testing.

FIXES IN UNCOMMITTED CHANGES:
- C2: tap advance (was event-based, merge fired before listener)
- C3B: new step bridging C3→D1 (pop prompt with 2s delay)
- Pressure: 0.3125 (C/D/E), fill timestamp adjustment, showOnInput

WHAT TO DO:
1. Run tests: npm run test:run
2. Commit round 5 fixes
3. Start dev server: npm run dev -- --host
4. Clear localStorage, test C2→C3→C3B→D→E→F flow
5. After full approval: 33-04-FIX-SUMMARY, ROADMAP, metadata commit
```

# Project State

## Current Position

Phase: 33 of 38 (Rank 0 Training Sequence)
Plan: 33-07 UAT in progress — D2 bugs fixed, continuing playthrough
Status: Tutorial v3 — UAT round 1: D2 fixed (3 commits), testing D2→F1 next
Last activity: 2026-02-23 — Fixed D2 retry (GOAL_PLUGGED, zero pressure, pulse highlight)

Progress: █████████░ 97%

## Branch Workflow (SOP)

**Standard procedure:** All new work happens on feature branches, not master.
- `master` = stable, tested code only
- Feature branches = work in progress
- Merge to master only after human verification passes

**Active feature branches:**
- `feature/tutorial-infrastructure` (Phase 31 complete, Phase 32 complete, Phase 33 in progress)

## Tutorial v3 Rewrite (2026-02-19)

### Why Rewrite
Tutorial v2 had persistent bugs through 11 UAT rounds. Root cause: fragile architecture with 20+ refs, 10+ pause/unpause locations, and custom handlers embedded in a 1400-line effect chain. Small changes caused destructive regressions. A clean rewrite with proper architecture is faster than continued patching.

### Design Document
**Source of truth:** `.planning/Tutorial3.md`
- Full audit of v2 (every step, every pattern, every coupling point)
- All designer questions answered and confirmed
- 15 steps across 6 phases (E2_POP_SEALED removed, E3 renumbered to E2)
- Architecture direction: state machine, handler registry, timeout pool

### Key Decisions Confirmed
| Decision | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Architecture | State machine pattern (ENTERING -> WAITING -> MESSAGE_VISIBLE -> ARMED -> ADVANCING) |
| Step count | 15 steps, 6 phases (A:1, B:4, C:4, D:3, E:2, F:1) |
| E-phase | E2_POP_SEALED eliminated, absorbed into E1 via standard hint pattern. E3->E2 renumbered. |
| Crack sealing | Two-step: plug on lock, seal on pop (implemented in plan 33-05) |
| D3 trigger | CRACK_OFFSCREEN event (implemented in plan 33-05) |
| D2 retry | Accumulate cracks (never remove old ones) instead of pop-all reset |
| F1 exit | Console screen, rank 0->1 (no end screen). Replays don't affect rank. |
| Config editing | All timings/colors/pause states as named config fields, easy to change |
| Garble system | Keep exactly as-is |
| Future tutorials | Same system reused at higher ranks for new concepts |

### GSD Plans
```
Plan 33-05: Engine Prerequisites (2 tasks) — COMPLETE (b6f4a40)
  1. Two-step crack sealing (plug on lock, seal on pop, glow indicator)
  2. CRACK_OFFSCREEN event (fires when arrow first appears)

Plan 33-06: Tutorial Framework + Step Configs (2 tasks) — COMPLETE (ef26d1d, c3ec712)
  1. State machine framework (lifecycle states, timeout pool, handler registry, types)
  2. Step configs (15 steps) + messages + standard handler implementations

Plan 33-07: Custom Handlers + Integration + UAT (2 tasks + 1 checkpoint)
  1. Custom handlers (D2 retry, D3 discovery, E1 seal+pop, F1 freeplay) — COMPLETE (64431c3)
  2. Wire into Game.tsx, GameBoard, TutorialOverlay, remove old code — COMPLETE (c7c30cb)
  3. Full A1->F1 playthrough verification — IN PROGRESS (UAT round 1)
     - D2 bugs found and fixed (6157603, 5ddd66d, 66e2b91)
     - Operator precedence fix (0126ca8)
     - D3 post-seal delay added — droplets fade before message (next commit)
     - E1 pop always skipped E2 (fixed — only skip if pop before hint)
     - A1→D2 verified working, continuing D2→F1
```

### UAT Round 1 Fixes
- **GOAL_PLUGGED vs GOAL_CAPTURED**: Retry handler listened for seal (pop) instead of plug (lock). Same fix applied to E1.
- **D2 pressure → 0**: Retries caused pressure rise, making E1 cracks spawn too high.
- **Post-plug pulse**: Added `dynamicHighlight` state so highlight flows through React props (not just engine-direct). Green goop pulses + restricts popping to green only. Reuses E1_SEAL_CRACK message for "Pop to seal" hint after 3s.
- **Operator precedence**: `??` mixed with `||` needs parentheses (TypeScript strict).
- **D3 post-seal timing**: Added `pauseDelay: 1500` to D3 so pop droplets fade before message shows (matches C3 pattern).
- **D3 fully disabled**: D3 step commented out of TRAINING_SEQUENCE. All D3 inline code (discovery listener, D3-current-step poll, discovery interrupt dismiss, autoSkip D3 flag) commented out. Will be re-integrated later as a parallel listener, not a step. Sequence is now 14 steps: D2→E1 direct.

### What Plan 33-06 Built
- **State machine:** `hooks/tutorial/stateMachine.ts` — 5 lifecycle states with derived properties
- **Timeout pool:** `hooks/tutorial/timeoutPool.ts` — Named timers, clearAll on step change
- **Handler registry:** `hooks/tutorial/handlers.ts` — Standard + stubs for 4 custom handlers
- **Types updated:** `types/training.ts` — 15 step IDs, handlerType, hintDelay, state machine types
- **Orchestrator:** `hooks/useTrainingFlow.ts` — Rewritten using pool + state machine (same Game.tsx interface)
- **Step configs:** `data/trainingScenarios.ts` — 15 steps with handlerType assignments
- **Messages:** `data/tutorialSteps.ts` — 15 messages, F1 endings, D2 retry

### What Plan 33-07 Tasks 1-2 Built
- **retryHandler.ts:** D2 retry with accumulating cracks, hint-after-plug pattern (135 lines)
- **discoveryHandler.ts:** Cross-step CRACK_OFFSCREEN listener, fires once, parallel operation (114 lines)
- **continuousHandler.ts:** E1 continuous spawn + GOAL_CAPTURED + hint pattern + E2 skip (134 lines)
- **freeplayHandler.ts:** F1 free play, pressure cap cycle, overflow, swipe-up exit (131 lines)
- **handlers.ts:** Extended HandlerContext with orchestrator state accessors and spawn helpers
- **GameEngine.ts:** Removed [LOCK] v2 debug logging
- **useTrainingFlow.ts:** Removed all v2 debug logging ([STEP], [CRACK], [E1], [F1]), cleaned unused imports

### Next Steps
1. Continue UAT: D2 verified → play through D3, E1, E2, F1
2. Fix any issues found, then complete plan 33-07

## Prior Work (v2 — for reference)

<details>
<summary>Tutorial v2 History (UAT rounds 1-11)</summary>

### What v2 Built (2026-02-15)
- 16 steps (A:1, B:4, C:4, D:3, E:3, F:1), 6 phases
- All new step IDs, messages, and scenario configs
- 6 features: continuousSpawn, pressureCap, periodicCrackInterval, autoSkipMs, persistent D3 discovery, F1 ending states
- Pop-lowers-pressure, F1 graduation + overflow endings

### UAT Rounds Summary
- **Rounds 1-6**: Basic flow fixes, rendering, progression bugs
- **Rounds 7-8**: Message stability, E-phase split, pressure cap
- **Rounds 9-10**: E-phase redesign, F1 soft crash, message flash fixes
- **Round 11**: E1 GOAL_CAPTURED not firing (2 root causes found, fixes applied but untested)

### Architecture Problems Identified
- 1400-line useTrainingFlow.ts with 20+ refs
- Pause/unpause in 10+ scattered locations
- 4 steps with 200+ lines of custom code embedded in main effect
- Deferred timeouts requiring generation counter pattern
- D3 discovery crossing step boundaries via intentionally un-cleaned ref
- trainingPopLowersPressure set but never read by engine

</details>

## Known Issues

- PiecePreview NEXT/HOLD labels at 18px may be too large for 48px box
- Some SVG text in Art.tsx not yet standardized
- **Fill rendering "almost hole" inversion**: fillRule="evenodd" issue with near-touching vertices

### Resume Command
```
Phase 33 — Tutorial v3 Rewrite

Plan 33-07 UAT round 1 in progress. D2 bugs fixed and verified.

WHAT TO DO:
1. Continue UAT from D2 onward (A1→D1 verified, D2 fixed)
   - D3 discovery: fires once when offscreen arrow appears
   - E1: continuous spawn + plug → hint → pop to seal
   - E2: scaffolding message
   - F1: graduation → free play → pressure cap cycle → overflow → exit
2. Fix any issues found, then complete plan 33-07

# Project State

## Branch Workflow (SOP)

**Standard procedure:** All new work happens on feature branches, not master.
- `master` = stable, tested code only
- Feature branches = work in progress
- Merge to master only after human verification passes

**Active feature branches:**
- None — v1.2 complete, ready for bug fix work

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-24)

**Core value:** The game feels satisfying to play on mobile - responsive controls, smooth animations, no input lag.
**Current focus:** v1.2 shipped — bug fixes and testing before next milestone

## Current Position

Phase: 20 (Expanding Cracks Overhaul)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-01-24 — Completed 20-01-PLAN.md

Progress: █████████████████████ 53/53 plans

## What's Done

### v1.2 Progression System (Shipped 2026-01-24)

- Active ability system with per-ability charge times
- Lights malfunction rework (player-controlled brightness)
- Expanding cracks mechanic
- 3 new colors: Orange@10, Purple@20, White@30

See [v1.2-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md) for full details.

### v1.1 Architecture Refactor (Shipped 2026-01-21)

All 6 phases (8-13) complete. See [v1.1-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md) for full details.

All 7 phases complete. See [v1.0-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md) for full details.

## Accumulated Context

### Balance Summary (Current v1.2.0)

| Complication | Trigger | Player Mitigation |
|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| Laser | Capacitor drains on pop | +10% refill on piece lock |
| Controls | Heat builds on rotate | Heat dissipates when idle |
| Lights | Brightness dims when not soft dropping | Soft drop to recharge |

All three complications have player-driven triggers AND mitigations.

### Active Abilities (v1.2.0)

| Active | Charge Time | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Cooldown Booster | 20s | +25% cooldown | +35% | +50% |
| Goop Dump | 15s | 1 wave (18 pcs) | 2 waves | 3 waves |
| Goop Colorizer | 25s | 6 match | 7 match | 8 match |
| Crack Down | 30s | 3 cracks low | 5 cracks | 7 cracks |

## Known Issues (Post v1.2)

**Fixed:**
- Gravity pieces now interact with cracks (v1.1.27)
- Non-matching color pieces no longer destroy cracks (they persist under goop)

**Researched (see INVESTIGATIONS.md):**
- Tetris movement feel — IMPLEMENTED (v1.1.29-33)
- Pressure not rising bug — debug logging added, waiting for next occurrence

### Tetris Movement Feel — COMPLETE

| Feature | Version | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Move reset lock delay | v1.1.29 | ✓ Done |
| 10-reset limit | v1.1.30 | ✓ Done |
| Upward kicks (y:-2) | v1.1.31 | ✓ Done |
| Slide into gaps while falling | v1.1.32 | ✓ Done |
| Snap to grid when sliding into tight gaps | v1.1.33 | ✓ Done |

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-25
**Version:** 1.1.50
Stopped at: Bug fixes and polish complete

### This Session Summary (2026-01-25)

**Bug Fixes & Polish (v1.1.46-50)**

1. **Distance penalty increased to 25%** (v1.1.46)
   - `core/GameEngine.ts:1198` — changed from 0.15 to 0.25
   - Cracks now limited to ~3 cells instead of ~4-6

2. **Ghost piece visibility improved** (v1.1.46-48)
   - Added transparent color fill (20% opacity) behind dashed outline
   - Fixed: `getContourPath` creates disconnected lines (unfillable), switched to `<rect>`
   - Outline opacity increased to 75%
   - Helps distinguish orange vs red, and split-color pieces

3. **O piece rotation fixed for split-colors** (v1.1.49-50)
   - Previously skipped rotation entirely (optimization for single-color)
   - v1.1.49: Enabled rotation but piece jumped (rotated around 0,0)
   - v1.1.50: Fixed — rotates `cellColors` array instead of cell positions
   - Shape stays in place, colors rotate visually around center

**All deployed to:** https://thebluemuzzy.github.io/GOOPS/

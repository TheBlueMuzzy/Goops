# Project State

## Branch Workflow (SOP)

**Standard procedure:** All new work happens on feature branches, not master.
- `master` = stable, tested code only
- Feature branches = work in progress
- Merge to master only after human verification passes

**Active feature branches:**
- `soft-body-experiment` — Soft Body Goop (SBG) visual overhaul (Proto-5c IN PROGRESS)

## Next Steps

**Current:** Proto-5c Cell Wall Rendering
**Status:** COMPLETE — Inner regions now wobble like T/U shapes
**Branch:** `soft-body-experiment`
**Server:** `localhost:5201/GOOPS/?proto=5c`

### Proto-5c Cell Wall Experiment — SOLVED

**The Goal:**
Render goop with a "cell wall" effect:
- **Outer edge** = gooey silhouette that stretches and merges (like Proto-5b)
- **Inner edge** = stable boundary that barely moves
- **Cell wall** = the visible filled ring BETWEEN outer and inner
- **Interior** = empty space for future "time to pop" fill

**The Approach:**
1. Layer 1: Render outer gooey shape with goo filter (filled, like 5b)
2. Layer 2: Render inner shape on top with background color (cuts out the middle)
3. Result: visible cell wall ring

**The Problem (SOLVED):**
Corrupt shape inner cutouts weren't wobbling like T/U shapes because they had separate physics vertices instead of deriving from the outer vertices.

**The Fix:**
Added `outerVertexIndices` to `InnerRegion` interface. Each inner region corner maps to a specific outer vertex. At render time, inner positions are derived directly from outer vertex positions (not simulated separately).

Mappings for Corrupt shape:
- Top-left square → outer vertices [0, 1, 2, 19]
- Top-right square → outer vertices [12, 13, 14, 11]
- Stem rectangle → outer vertices [5, 8, 7, 6]

**Key Code:**
```typescript
interface InnerRegion {
  outerVertexIndices?: number[];  // Maps corners to outer vertices (for wobble)
  // ... other fields
}

// Rendering: use outer vertex positions when available
if (region.outerVertexIndices) {
  worldPoints = region.outerVertexIndices.map(idx => blob.vertices[idx].pos);
} else {
  worldPoints = region.vertices.map(v => v.pos);  // fallback
}
```

**Key Files:**
- `prototypes/SoftBodyProto5c.tsx` — Main prototype file

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-31
**Version:** 1.1.13
**Branch:** soft-body-experiment
**Build:** 108

### Resume Command
```
Proto-5c cell wall experiment COMPLETE. Branch: soft-body-experiment
Server: localhost:5201/GOOPS/?proto=5c

SOLVED: Corrupt inner regions now wobble like T/U shapes.
Fix: Added outerVertexIndices to InnerRegion — maps each inner corner to outer vertex.
At render time, inner positions derive from outer vertices (not simulated separately).

Next: Move to Proto-6 (Fill/Pour) or integrate cell wall into main game.
File: prototypes/SoftBodyProto5c.tsx
```

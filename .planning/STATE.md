# Project State

## Branch Workflow (SOP)

**Standard procedure:** All new work happens on feature branches, not master.
- `master` = stable, tested code only
- Feature branches = work in progress
- Merge to master only after human verification passes

**Active feature branches:**
- None — ready for v1.2 feature branch

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-21)

**Core value:** The game feels satisfying to play on mobile - responsive controls, smooth animations, no input lag.
**Current focus:** v1.2 progression system — ranks 0-39 with new upgrades and mechanics

## Current Position

Phase: 15 of 18 (Onboarding Band)
Plan: 4 of 4 complete
Status: Complete
Last activity: 2026-01-24 — Completed 15-04-PLAN.md (Phase 15 complete)

Progress: ████░░░░░░ 22%

## v1.1 Architecture Refactor

**Goal:** Fix memory leaks, split large files, centralize state management, expand test coverage.

**Phases:**
- ✅ Phase 8: Quick Wins & Memory Fixes (2026-01-21)
- ✅ Phase 9: Art.tsx Decomposition (2026-01-21)
- ✅ Phase 10: GameBoard.tsx Decomposition (2026-01-21)
- ✅ Phase 11: GameEngine Refactor (2026-01-21)
- ✅ Phase 12: State Management & Events (2026-01-21)
- ✅ Phase 13: Testing & Documentation (2026-01-21)

**Constraints:**
- All 110 tests must pass throughout (81 at Phase 12 + 29 new in Phase 13)
- No gameplay changes
- Each phase independently deployable

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ No files over 400 lines
- ✅ All hard-coded values in constants.ts
- ✅ GameEngine.tick() under 50 lines (22 lines achieved)
- ✅ Event-based communication replaces prop drilling

## What's Done

### v1.1 Architecture Refactor (Shipped 2026-01-21)

All 6 phases (8-13) complete. See [v1.1-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md) for full details.

**Key accomplishments:**
- Art.tsx: 1,478 → 581 lines (61% reduction)
- GameBoard.tsx: 1,031 → 604 lines (41% reduction)
- GameEngine.tick(): 159 → 22 lines (86% reduction)
- Tests: 65 → 110 (69% increase)
- Event-based input, 6 callback props removed

### v1.0 MVP (Shipped 2026-01-21)

All 7 phases complete. See [v1.0-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md) for full details.

## Audit Findings (from discuss-milestone)

**Critical Issues:**
- ~~Art.tsx: 1,478 lines~~ ✅ Fixed in Phase 9 (581 lines)
- ~~GameBoard.tsx: 1,052 lines~~ ✅ Fixed in Phase 10 (604 lines, 41% reduction)
- ~~rotationTimestamps memory leak~~ ✅ Fixed in Phase 8 (circular buffer)

**High Priority:**
- ~~GameEngine.tick() is 167 lines~~ ✅ Fixed in Phase 11 (22 lines)
- ~~Hard-coded values scattered~~ ✅ Fixed in Phase 8 (complicationConfig.ts)
- ~~State fragmented across 6 locations~~ ✅ Documented in Phase 12 (GameStateManager interface)
- ~~Prop drilling (10+ callbacks to GameBoard)~~ ✅ Fixed in Phase 12 (6 callbacks removed)

See `.planning/SYSTEM-INVENTORY.md` for complete system list.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All key decisions documented in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

### Key Technical Discovery

**SVG Coordinate Conversion with preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid slice"**

Simple viewBox math doesn't work. Must use:
```tsx
const refPoint = document.getElementById('coord-reference');
const ctm = refPoint.getScreenCTM();
const svgPoint = screenPoint.matrixTransform(ctm.inverse());
```

### Deferred Issues

None — all UAT issues resolved.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-24
Stopped at: Completed 15-04-PLAN.md (AUTO_POPPER, COOLDOWN_BOOSTER, Active Ability UI)
Resume file: None
Phase 15 Status: COMPLETE — Ready for Phase 16 (Junk Band)

### Level Effects Decided This Session

| Upgrade | Levels | Effect per Level |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| Circuit Stabilizer | 4 | -7.5% trigger chance |
| Auto-Popper | 4 | -4% decay (from -20% base) |
| Capacitor Efficiency | 4 | -6.25% drain |
| Gear Lubrication | 4 | +12.5% dissipation |
| Focus Mode | 4 | -10% time speed |
| Dense Goop | 4 | +12.5% fall speed |
| Pressure Control | 8 | +5 seconds |
| Junk Uniformer | 4 | +10% same-color |
| Goop Swap | 4 | -0.25s (1.5s→0.5s) |
| Sealing Bonus | 4 | +5% (10% base) |
| Slow Cracks | 4 | -5% growth offset |
| Crack Matcher | 4 | +25% color bias |

### Mechanic Redesigns Noted

**Sealing Bonus:** Actives use cooldowns (not pop-counts). Sealing crack = 10% base cooldown reduction. Upgrade adds +5%/level. Implementation in later phases.

**Slow Cracks:** Cracks grow every 5s from inception, % chance = current pressure. Upgrade offsets that chance.

### Uncommitted Changes

None

### Bugs/Blockers

None

### Next Steps

1. `/gsd:plan-phase 16` — Plan Phase 16: Junk Band (Junk Goop complication, Orange color, 4 new upgrades)

# Project State

## Current Position

Phase: 33 of 38 (Rank 0 Training Sequence)
Plan: 2 of 4 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-08 - Completed 33-02-PLAN.md

Progress: ███░░░░░░░ 32%

## Branch Workflow (SOP)

**Standard procedure:** All new work happens on feature branches, not master.
- `master` = stable, tested code only
- Feature branches = work in progress
- Merge to master only after human verification passes

**Active feature branches:**
- `feature/tutorial-infrastructure` (Phase 31 complete, Phase 32 complete, Phase 33 in progress)

## Next Steps

Phase 33 plan 2 of 4 complete. Next: 33-03 (Intercom scripts & journal content).

### Decisions Made

- Typography: 18px minimum body, CSS classes with !important, full project sweep
- Journal layout: accordion (single column) over sidebar+content (two column)
- TEXT_MANIFEST.md as editable text source-of-truth
- **Training: scripted 17-step sequence (1 continuous session) over 6 discrete scenarios**
- Training uses COLORS.RED hex values matching engine convention
- Training mode: pendingTrainingPalette interception pattern in enterPeriscope()
- Training tick() gates skip all normal gameplay systems (complications, goals, cracks, heat, lights)

### Known Issues

- PiecePreview NEXT/HOLD labels at 18px may be too large for 48px box — revisit layout later
- Some SVG text in Art.tsx (PROMOTION THRESHOLD at 12px, XP at 14px) not yet standardized — SVG coordinate space differs from screen pixels

### Roadmap Evolution

- Milestone v1.5 shipped: Soft-body goop rendering, 4 completed phases (2026-02-08)
- Milestone v1.6 created: Progressive Tutorial, 8 phases (Phase 31-38)

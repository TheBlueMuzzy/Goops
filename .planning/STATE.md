# Project State

## Branch Workflow (SOP)

**Standard procedure:** All new work happens on feature branches, not master.
- `master` = stable, tested code only
- Feature branches = work in progress
- Merge to master only after human verification passes

**Active feature branches:**
- None — ready for v1.2 feature branch

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-21)

**Core value:** The game feels satisfying to play on mobile - responsive controls, smooth animations, no input lag.
**Current focus:** v1.2 progression system — ranks 0-39 with new upgrades and mechanics

## Current Position

Phase: 13 of 13 (Testing & Documentation) — COMPLETE
Plan: 2/2 complete
Status: **v1.1 MILESTONE SHIPPED** — Tagged v1.1, ready to merge
Last activity: 2026-01-21 — v1.1 milestone archived

Progress: ███████████████████████████████████ 13/13 plans (100%)

## v1.1 Architecture Refactor

**Goal:** Fix memory leaks, split large files, centralize state management, expand test coverage.

**Phases:**
- ✅ Phase 8: Quick Wins & Memory Fixes (2026-01-21)
- ✅ Phase 9: Art.tsx Decomposition (2026-01-21)
- ✅ Phase 10: GameBoard.tsx Decomposition (2026-01-21)
- ✅ Phase 11: GameEngine Refactor (2026-01-21)
- ✅ Phase 12: State Management & Events (2026-01-21)
- ✅ Phase 13: Testing & Documentation (2026-01-21)

**Constraints:**
- All 110 tests must pass throughout (81 at Phase 12 + 29 new in Phase 13)
- No gameplay changes
- Each phase independently deployable

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ No files over 400 lines
- ✅ All hard-coded values in constants.ts
- ✅ GameEngine.tick() under 50 lines (22 lines achieved)
- ✅ Event-based communication replaces prop drilling

## What's Done

### v1.1 Architecture Refactor (Shipped 2026-01-21)

All 6 phases (8-13) complete. See [v1.1-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md) for full details.

**Key accomplishments:**
- Art.tsx: 1,478 → 581 lines (61% reduction)
- GameBoard.tsx: 1,031 → 604 lines (41% reduction)
- GameEngine.tick(): 159 → 22 lines (86% reduction)
- Tests: 65 → 110 (69% increase)
- Event-based input, 6 callback props removed

### v1.0 MVP (Shipped 2026-01-21)

All 7 phases complete. See [v1.0-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md) for full details.

## Audit Findings (from discuss-milestone)

**Critical Issues:**
- ~~Art.tsx: 1,478 lines~~ ✅ Fixed in Phase 9 (581 lines)
- ~~GameBoard.tsx: 1,052 lines~~ ✅ Fixed in Phase 10 (604 lines, 41% reduction)
- ~~rotationTimestamps memory leak~~ ✅ Fixed in Phase 8 (circular buffer)

**High Priority:**
- ~~GameEngine.tick() is 167 lines~~ ✅ Fixed in Phase 11 (22 lines)
- ~~Hard-coded values scattered~~ ✅ Fixed in Phase 8 (complicationConfig.ts)
- ~~State fragmented across 6 locations~~ ✅ Documented in Phase 12 (GameStateManager interface)
- ~~Prop drilling (10+ callbacks to GameBoard)~~ ✅ Fixed in Phase 12 (6 callbacks removed)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All key decisions documented in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

### Key Technical Discovery

**SVG Coordinate Conversion with preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid slice"**

Simple viewBox math doesn't work. Must use:
```tsx
const refPoint = document.getElementById('coord-reference');
const ctm = refPoint.getScreenCTM();
const svgPoint = screenPoint.matrixTransform(ctm.inverse());
```

### Deferred Issues

None — all UAT issues resolved.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-23
Stopped at: v1.2 progression design captured in MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md

### Current Task State

**Completed this session:**
- /gsd:discuss-milestone for v1.2
- Full progression table defined (ranks 0-39)
- 17 upgrades identified across 4 bands
- Color schedule finalized: Orange@10, Purple@20, White@30
- MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md written and committed

### Uncommitted Changes

None — all committed and pushed.

### Bugs/Blockers

None

### Next Steps

1. `/clear` — Fresh context window
2. Define level effects for each upgrade (12 passives need scaling values)
3. Explain intent behind each mechanic
4. `/gsd:new-milestone` — Create v1.2 milestone with implementation phases

# Project State

## Branch Workflow (SOP)

**Standard procedure:** All new work happens on feature branches, not master.
- `master` = stable, tested code only
- Feature branches = work in progress
- Merge to master only after human verification passes

**Active feature branches:**
- `soft-body-experiment` — Soft Body Goop (SBG) visual overhaul (Proto-8 IN PROGRESS)

## Next Steps

**Current:** Proto-8 Pop
**Status:** IN PROGRESS - Dev menu added, pressure system rebuilt
**Branch:** `soft-body-experiment`

### Proto-8 Pop — IN PROGRESS

**The Goal:**
Test what happens when goop is cleared — pop effect with droplet residue.

**What Works:**
- Pop effect: click filled blobs to spawn droplets that scatter and fade
- Droplets bounce off floor, exit through sides (matches real game - no side walls)
- Blob-to-blob collision for different colors (push apart, don't overlap)
- Dev menu toggles with ` key
- Save/Load settings to localStorage
- Debug vertex visualization for merged blobs (yellow numbered dots)

**Pressure System Rebuilt:**
Old area-based pressure had bugs with complex merged shapes (inverted blobs). New approach:
- Radial spring model: each vertex wants to maintain its rest distance from center
- Compressed → pushes out, Stretched → pulls in
- No pressure on falling pieces (only locked blobs)
- Still being tuned - may need adjustment

**Key Technical Findings:**
- Perimeter winding order matters for pressure normals (CCW = outward)
- Added winding detection and auto-reversal if clockwise
- Momentum transfer during merge was causing instability (needs review)

**Key Files:**
- `prototypes/SoftBodyProto8.tsx` — Pop mechanics prototype
- Access via: `?proto=8`

**Next:**
- Tune pressure system for good bounciness without instability
- Test pop effect feel
- Proto-9 (Loose Goop) — how freed goop behaves

### Proto-7 Merge — COMPLETE ✅

**The Goal:**
Test dynamic blob generation when pieces lock — the bridge between prototype shapes and real game integration.

**What Works:**
- Grid-based test environment (6x8 cells, 50px each)
- Dynamic blob generation from grid cells (perimeter tracing algorithm)
- Falling pieces are full/solid (no inner cutout) with physics
- Smooth continuous falling (not grid-step) like the real game
- Same-color merge: pieces combine into one blob, new unified inner cutout, fill restarts at 0%
- Different-color: just neighbors, no merge
- Physics momentum transfer on merge (less jarring transition)
- Impact effect on locked pieces when new piece lands (localized to contact points)
- Return Speed slider — controls how fast blobs return to shape (falling pieces use full speed)
- Viscosity slider — honey-like slow return for locked pieces
- Distance-based cross springs — arms of T/L shapes can swing independently
- Solid container — blobs squish against floor/walls with soft damping

**Tuned Default Settings:**
| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Damping | 0.97 | High, preserves momentum |
| Stiffness | 1 | Very low, loose springs |
| Pressure | 5 | Strong volume maintenance |
| Home Stiffness | 0.01 | Very weak shape pull |
| Inner Stiffness | 0.1 | Slightly stiffer core |
| Return Speed | 0.5 | Moderate return speed |
| Viscosity | 2.5 | Very honey-like |
| Iterations | 3 | Standard |
| Impact Strength | 5 | Subtle squish on landing |
| Impact Radius | 1.5 | cells |
| Fall Speed | 200 | px/sec |

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- `canFallMore` check: piece can only fall if ALL cells can move down (not any)
- Impact uses actual contact points (where cells touch grid), not blob centers
- Per-vertex distance check for localized impulse application
- Cross springs distance-based (75px max) instead of index-based for independent arm movement
- Viscosity/returnSpeed skip for falling pieces (they stay snappy)
- Boundary constraints use soft damping (30%) instead of hard stop

**Key Files:**
- `prototypes/SoftBodyProto7.tsx` — Merge mechanics prototype
- Access via: `?proto=7`

**Next:**
- Proto-8 (Pop) — what happens when goop is cleared?
- Proto-9 (Loose Goop) — how freed goop behaves

### Proto-6 Fill/Pour — COMPLETE ✅

**The Goal:**
- Fill rises from bottom inside the cell wall "container"
- Fill color matches outer goop exactly
- When 100% filled, looks like solid goop (no visible seam)
- Shake animation when clicking before 100%
- Boop scale pulse when fill reaches 100%

**The Solution: "Trim" Approach**

Instead of adding a fill layer, we **clip the inner cutout** to reveal the goop underneath:

```
LAYER 1: Outer goop (solid, filtered)
LAYER 2: Inner cutout (bgColor, CLIPPED to unfilled portion only)
```

**How it works:**
- The inner cutout is clipped with a rect that only shows the "unfilled" area (above fill line)
- As fill increases, the clip rect shrinks from bottom up
- This reveals the goop underneath as the "fill"
- At 100% fill, cutout disappears entirely → solid goop shows

**Why this is better than previous attempts:**
- The "fill" IS the outer goop, so it has the same gooey edges
- No seam because we're not trying to match two different paths
- Simpler architecture (2 layers instead of 3)
- Like After Effects "trim" effect — revealing rather than adding

**What Works:**
- Fill amount (0-1) per blob, auto-fills over time
- Fill effect via clipped cutout (reveals goop from bottom up)
- Shake animation on early click (CSS keyframes)
- Boop scale animation at 100% (scale from center)
- Reset button to empty all containers
- No visible seam at any fill level

**Key Files:**
- `prototypes/SoftBodyProto6.tsx` — Complete fill/pour mechanics

### Proto-5c Cell Wall Experiment — SOLVED

**The Goal:**
Render goop with a "cell wall" effect:
- **Outer edge** = gooey silhouette that stretches and merges (like Proto-5b)
- **Inner edge** = stable boundary that barely moves
- **Cell wall** = the visible filled ring BETWEEN outer and inner
- **Interior** = empty space for future "time to pop" fill

**The Approach:**
1. Layer 1: Render outer gooey shape with goo filter (filled, like 5b)
2. Layer 2: Render inner shape on top with background color (cuts out the middle)
3. Result: visible cell wall ring

**The Problem (SOLVED):**
Corrupt shape inner cutouts weren't wobbling like T/U shapes because they had separate physics vertices instead of deriving from the outer vertices.

**The Fix:**
Added `outerVertexIndices` to `InnerRegion` interface. Each inner region corner maps to a specific outer vertex. At render time, inner positions are derived directly from outer vertex positions (not simulated separately).

Mappings for Corrupt shape:
- Top-left square → outer vertices [0, 1, 2, 19]
- Top-right square → outer vertices [12, 13, 14, 11]
- Stem rectangle → outer vertices [5, 8, 7, 6]

**Key Code:**
```typescript
interface InnerRegion {
  outerVertexIndices?: number[];  // Maps corners to outer vertices (for wobble)
  // ... other fields
}

// Rendering: use outer vertex positions when available
if (region.outerVertexIndices) {
  worldPoints = region.outerVertexIndices.map(idx => blob.vertices[idx].pos);
} else {
  worldPoints = region.vertices.map(v => v.pos);  // fallback
}
```

**Key Files:**
- `prototypes/SoftBodyProto5c.tsx` — Main prototype file

# Project State

## Branch Workflow (SOP)

**Standard procedure:** All new work happens on feature branches, not master.
- `master` = stable, tested code only
- Feature branches = work in progress
- Merge to master only after human verification passes

**Active feature branches:**
- None — v1.2 complete, ready for bug fix work

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-24)

**Core value:** The game feels satisfying to play on mobile - responsive controls, smooth animations, no input lag.
**Current focus:** v1.2 shipped — bug fixes and testing before next milestone

## Current Position

Phase: 18 of 18 (all complete)
Plan: All plans complete
Status: v1.2 SHIPPED
Last activity: 2026-01-24 — v1.2 milestone archived

Progress: ████████████████████ 49/49 plans (v1.0 + v1.1 + v1.2 complete)

## What's Done

### v1.2 Progression System (Shipped 2026-01-24)

Full ranks 0-39 progression with 4 bands, 20 upgrades, and 3 new colors.

Key features:
- 20 upgrades across passive/active/feature types
- Active ability system with per-ability charge times
- Lights malfunction rework (player-controlled brightness)
- Expanding cracks mechanic
- 3 new colors: Orange@10, Purple@20, White@30

See [v1.2-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md) for full details.

### v1.1 Architecture Refactor (Shipped 2026-01-21)

All 6 phases (8-13) complete. See [v1.1-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md) for full details.

### v1.0 MVP (Shipped 2026-01-21)

All 7 phases complete. See [v1.0-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md) for full details.

## Accumulated Context

### Balance Summary (Current v1.2.0)

| Complication | Trigger | Player Mitigation |
|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| Laser | Capacitor drains on pop | +10% refill on piece lock |
| Controls | Heat builds on rotate | Heat dissipates when idle |
| Lights | Brightness dims when not soft dropping | Soft drop to recharge |

All three complications have player-driven triggers AND mitigations.

### Active Abilities (v1.2.0)

| Active | Charge Time | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Cooldown Booster | 20s | +25% cooldown | +35% | +50% |
| Goop Dump | 15s | 1 wave (18 pcs) | 2 waves | 3 waves |
| Goop Colorizer | 25s | 6 match | 7 match | 8 match |
| Crack Down | 30s | 3 cracks low | 5 cracks | 7 cracks |

## Known Issues (Post v1.2)

**Fixed:**
- Gravity pieces now interact with cracks (v1.1.27)
- Non-matching color pieces no longer destroy cracks (they persist under goop)

**Researched (see INVESTIGATIONS.md):**
- Tetris movement feel — IMPLEMENTED (v1.1.29-33)
- Pressure not rising bug — debug logging added, waiting for next occurrence

### Tetris Movement Feel — COMPLETE

| Feature | Version | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Move reset lock delay | v1.1.29 | ✓ Done |
| 10-reset limit | v1.1.30 | ✓ Done |
| Upward kicks (y:-2) | v1.1.31 | ✓ Done |
| Slide into gaps while falling | v1.1.32 | ✓ Done |
| Snap to grid when sliding into tight gaps | v1.1.33 | ✓ Done |

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-24
**Version:** 1.1.33

### This Session Summary (2026-01-24)

**What was done:**
- Researched Tetris movement feel — documented in INVESTIGATIONS.md
- Implemented move reset lock delay (v1.1.29): rotation/movement resets 500ms lock timer
- Reduced reset limit to 10 (v1.1.30) after user testing
- Lights grace timer now pauses during console/minigame views (v1.1.30)
- Added debug logging for pressure bug (still investigating)
- **Phase 2 kicks (v1.1.31):** Added upward kick tests (y:-2) to allow pieces to climb 2 rows via rotation
- **Slide into gaps fix (v1.1.32):** Fixed collision check to use rounded Y for horizontal movement
- **Grid snap fix (v1.1.33):** Snap piece to grid when sliding into tight gaps

**Root cause of slide-into-gaps bug:** Fractional Y positions (e.g., 16.49) caused collision check to straddle two rows, blocking slides into single-row gaps. Fix: check collision at `Math.round(y)` for horizontal movement.

**Decisions made:**
- Move reset limit = 10 (middle ground between Tetris's 15 and user's instinct of 5)
- Lights timer pauses in console to prevent feels-bad chain after minigames
- Added 3 new kick offsets: {0,-2}, {1,-2}, {-1,-2} for tucking under overhangs
- Horizontal movement uses rounded Y for collision, snaps if needed

**Known bug:**
- Pressure not rising bug — debug logging added, waiting for next occurrence

**Next session:**
- Monitor debug logs for pressure bug
- Continue testing movement feel improvements

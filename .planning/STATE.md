# Project State

## Branch Workflow (SOP)

**Standard procedure:** All new work happens on feature branches, not master.
- `master` = stable, tested code only
- Feature branches = work in progress
- Merge to master only after human verification passes

**Active feature branches:**
- `soft-body-experiment` — Soft Body Goop (SBG) visual overhaul (RESEARCH COMPLETE)

## Next Steps

**Current:** Soft Body Goop prototype implementation
**Status:** PROTOTYPES 1-4 COMPLETE — Ready for Proto-5 (goo filter / membrane merge)
**Branch:** `soft-body-experiment`

**Vision + Research document:** `.planning/SOFTBODY-VISION.md`
**Prototypes:** Access via `localhost:PORT/GOOPS/?proto=N` (N = 1-4)

### Prototype Results Summary (2026-01-31)

#### Proto-1: Single Blob Physics ✅
**Question:** Does Verlet + springs + pressure + Catmull-Rom look/feel right?
**Answer:** YES — "gummy jello" feel achieved

**Tuned Parameters:**
- Damping: 0.975 (oscillations die naturally)
- Gravity: 30 (gentle, will be simulated by piece drop speed in game)
- Stiffness: 20 (soft but holds shape)
- Pressure: 2.5 (minimal visible effect at this scale)
- Constraint Iterations: 3+ (stable without expensive)

**Key Learnings:**
- Position-based constraints (not force-based) required for stability
- First-frame dt must be skipped to prevent physics explosion
- T-tetromino shape with 10 perimeter vertices works well

#### Proto-2: Blob Follows Cursor ✅
**Question:** Does two-layer architecture (data drives render) work?
**Answer:** YES — smooth follow, fantastic rotation morph

**Tuned Parameters:**
- Home Stiffness: 0.03 (laggy/stretchy follow, beautiful rotation)
- Damping: 0.92 (settles quickly after movement)
- Stiffness: 10 (very soft, allows natural deformation)
- Iterations: 3

**Key Learnings:**
- homeOffset per vertex defines rest shape relative to target position
- Rotate button morphs shape beautifully as vertices spring to new homes
- Low homeStiffness = more "gummy" feel during movement

#### Proto-3: Rotation Stress Test ✅
**Question:** Do rapid 90° rotations break physics or accumulate lag?
**Answer:** NO — deviation stays bounded even at 100ms auto-rotate

**Tuned Parameters:**
- Home Stiffness: 0.18 (snappy recovery for rapid rotations)
- Damping: 0.94 (quick settle without overshoot)

**Key Learnings:**
- Higher homeStiffness needed for rapid rotations (vs slow cursor follow)
- Deviation meter useful for tuning — peak stays bounded
- No infinite lag accumulation observed

#### Proto-4: Two Blobs Attraction ✅ COMPLETE
**Question:** Do vertex-to-vertex springs create the "reaching" effect?
**Answer:** YES — with per-vertex radii and variable stiffness

**Final Implementation:**
- T-tetromino (anchored, 4 blocks) + U-pentomino (draggable, 5 blocks)
- **Per-vertex attraction radii** (multipliers: outer=1.5x, inner=0.3x of slider)
- Connection triggers when circles TOUCH (sum of both radii)
- **Variable stiffness**: 10% at max distance → 100% when close (reaching → snapping)
- Block proximity filter scales with slider (4x for adequate range)

**Tuned Parameters:**
- Attraction Radius: slider × multiplier (outer vertices reach farther)
- Break Distance: 60 (effective stickiness)
- Rest Length: 0 (required for future merge calculations)
- Stiffness: ramps from 10% → 100% based on spring length

**Key Learnings:**
1. Per-VERTEX radius (not per-block) gives finest control
2. Outer vertices (edges) need larger radius; inner vertices (notches) need tiny radius
3. Connection = `dist < radiusA + radiusB` (circles touching, not overlapping)
4. Variable stiffness creates "searching/reaching" at range, firm pull when close
5. Block filter must scale with slider to avoid hard-coded bottleneck
6. Existing springs preserved independently of block proximity (only vertex distance matters)

**Critical Constraints for Proto-5+:**
- Attraction radius must NOT match or exceed grid vertex spacing (30px)
- If it does, vertices connect to wrong neighbors across the shape
- With multipliers: outer=1.5×30=45px reaches appropriately; inner=0.3×30=9px stays local

## Accumulated Context

### Balance Summary (Current v1.2.0)

| Complication | Trigger | Player Mitigation |
|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| Laser | Capacitor drains on pop | +10% refill on piece lock |
| Controls | Heat builds on rotate | Heat dissipates when idle |

| Goop Colorizer | 25s | 6 match | 7 match | 8 match |
| Crack Down | 30s | 3 cracks low | 5 cracks | 7 cracks |

## Known Issues

**Bugs:**
- None currently tracked

**Tech Debt:**
- None currently tracked

## Phase 21 Decisions (Piece Shapes)

### Timing & Speed Changes

| Constant | Current | New | Location |
|----------|---------|-----|----------|
| `INITIAL_TIME_MS` | 60000 | **75000** | `constants.ts` |
| `INITIAL_SPEED` | 800 | **780** | `GameEngine.ts` |
| `SOFT_DROP_FACTOR` | 6 | **8** | `GameEngine.ts` |

**Rationale:** 75 sec game with 25 sec per size zone. Target 5-6 pieces per zone at 70% fast drop usage. Snappier fast drop (8x vs 6x).

### Piece Size Progression

| Zone | Time | Pressure Row | Pieces Spawning |
|------|------|--------------|-----------------|
| Tetra | 0-25s | Start → row 13 | Tetrominoes only |
| Penta | 25-50s | Row 13 → row 8 | Pentominoes only |
| Hexa | 50-75s | Row 8 → end | Hexominoes only |

**Logic:** Cracks spawn near pressure line. Higher pressure = need taller pieces to reach cracks. Tetra max 4 tall, Penta max 5, Hexa max 6.

### Piece Definitions (from art/minos.svg)

| Category | Normal | Corrupted | Total |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Tetrominoes | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| Pentominoes | 11 | 11 | 22 |
| Hexominoes | 11 | 11 | 22 |
| **Total** | 27 | 27 | **54 base** |

### Spawn Mechanics

1. **Corruption:** 15% chance per spawn → use corrupted variant
2. **Mirrors:** If piece is asymmetric → 50% chance to flip
3. **Exclusive spawning:** Only one size active at a time (no mixing)

### Non-Contiguous Pieces

"Corrupted" pieces have corner-touching cells instead of edge-touching. Example: the current T piece (diagonal floater off 3-unit L). These enable:
- Selective popping (pop one part, keep other)
- Gap filling (straddle existing goop)
- Unique coverage patterns

### Key Files to Modify

- `constants.ts` — INITIAL_TIME_MS, new PIECES arrays
- `GameEngine.ts` — INITIAL_SPEED, SOFT_DROP_FACTOR, spawn logic for pressure-based size selection
- `types.ts` — New PieceType enum values
- `art/minos.svg` — Source of truth for piece shapes (parsed for coordinates)

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-31
**Version:** 1.1.13
**Branch:** soft-body-experiment
**Current work:** Soft Body Goop Prototypes 1-4

### This Session Summary (2026-01-31)

**Proto-5b COMPLETE — Gold Standard Achieved**

Proto-5b is the winner with all features working:

**Core Features:**
- Single perimeter shapes (T, U, Corrupted T)
- Gooey SVG filter for membrane merge
- Attraction springs between blobs with mozzarella pull
- Beads-on-string tendrils (solid vector look when stretched)
- Corrupted shapes work with pressure disabled

**Gold Standard Settings:**
| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Blur | 8 | stdDeviation |
| Alpha Mult | 20 | |
| Alpha Offset | -12 | Sharper edges |
| Goopiness | 25px | Break distance |
| Attraction Radius | 20px | Connection distance |
| Attraction Strength | 0.005 | Gentle pull |

**Key Learnings:**
- Beads-on-string approach for tendrils (not thick lines) - stays solid under filter
- Corrupted shapes need `usePressure: false` (self-intersecting perimeter breaks area calc)
- Per-vertex attraction multipliers: outer=1.5x, inner=0.3x
- Variable stiffness ramp: 10% at max distance → 100% when close

**Remaining Prototypes Before Game Integration:**

### Proto-6: Fill/Pour
**Question:** How does goop visually "fill" into a piece shape?

Possible approaches:
- **Pour from top:** Goop flows down and fills the shape like liquid
- **Expand from center:** Starts as small blob, expands to fill perimeter
- **Instant with wobble:** Full shape appears, then wobbles/settles
- **Drip accumulation:** Small blobs drip in and merge together

**When this happens in game:** When a new piece spawns? When piece locks?

### Proto-7: Pop
**Question:** What happens visually when goop is cleared?

Possible approaches:
- **Burst outward:** Vertices explode from center, then fade
- **Splatter:** Fragments fly off, stick to nearby surfaces briefly
- **Dissolve:** Shape shrinks/fades with wobble
- **Vacuum suck:** Gets pulled toward a point (the crack being sealed?)

**When this happens in game:** When a goop group is popped/cleared

### Proto-8: Loose Goop
**Question:** How does freed goop behave when disconnected?

This is the **LooseGoop** system — when corner-connected blocks separate, or when goop is freed:
- **Falls with physics:** Gravity + soft body deformation as it drops
- **Splashes on landing:** Squishes when hitting other goop/bottom
- **Merges with same color:** Attraction springs pull it into existing groups
- **Flows around obstacles:** Deforms to fit available space

**When this happens in game:** After pops, when corrupted pieces split

**Proto-9+: Integration** — Into actual game

**Architecture Insight (from user):**
- Game piece "home" = current invisible data piece position
- Soft body rendering replaces current block rendering
- Landing impact may need extra "squish" force (concern: soft body might not show force)
- No "line clears" — instead there's LooseGoop system (freed goop flows)

**Previous: Proto-4 Refined — Per-Vertex Attraction + Variable Stiffness**

Major improvements to Proto-4 attraction system:

1. **Fixed spring preservation bug** — existing springs now checked independently of block proximity
2. **Per-vertex attraction radii** — outer vertices (1.5x) reach farther, inner vertices (0.3x) stay local
3. **Circle-touch connection** — `dist < radiusA + radiusB` triggers when circles touch, not overlap
4. **Variable stiffness ramp** — 10% at max distance (gentle reaching) → 100% when close (firm pull)
5. **Scaled block filter** — 4x slider value prevents hard-coded bottleneck at large radii

**Final Proto-4 Parameters:**
- Break Distance: 60 (stickiness feel)
- Rest Length: 0 (required for merge calculations)
- Outer Multiplier: 1.5x slider
- Inner Multiplier: 0.3x slider
- Stiffness Ramp: 10% → 100% based on spring length

**Critical Insights for Proto-5+:**
- Attraction radius must be < vertex grid spacing (30px) or wrong connections form
- High home stiffness + high attraction stiffness = goop stays true to placement
- Lower values = more organic movement but may drift from data grid
- Rest length MUST be 0 or very close for merge detection to work
- Break distance 60-65 gives good "sticky" feeling

**All prototypes accessible via:** `localhost:PORT/GOOPS/?proto=N`

### Previous Session Summary (2026-01-30)

**Soft Body Goop Research — COMPLETE**

Comprehensive deep-dive research on soft body physics for the visual overhaul:

**1. Physics Deep-Dive:**
- Verlet integration preferred (stable, implicit velocity)
- Damping ratio ζ=0.5-0.7 for "gummy" feel
- 12 vertices per cell with ring + cross springs + pressure
- Concrete parameter values documented

**2. Rendering Deep-Dive:**
- Catmull-Rom splines pass through physics vertices (unlike Bezier)
- Simple conversion formula: `cp1 = P1 + (P2-P0)/6`
- SVG gooey filter for membrane merge between same-color cells
- Centripetal (α=0.5) prevents cusps, but uniform is fine for even spacing

**3. Field vs Spring Comparison:**
- **SPRINGS WIN** — gummy, stretchy feel (World of Goo uses this)
- Fields = floaty, magnetic feel (good for water, not goop)
- Springs create "reaching" effect; fields create "magnet snap"
- Spatial hashing required for 432 vertices

**All research documented in `.planning/SOFTBODY-VISION.md`**

### Previous Session Summary (2026-01-28)

**Win Bonus Rework — COMPLETE**

Redesigned win bonus to prevent multi-rank skipping and improve pacing:
- **Problem:** Old `rank × 5000` win bonus caused players to skip 5-10 ranks, missing unlocks
- **New system:** Win = guaranteed +1 rank, max +2 ranks per shift total
- **Implementation:**
  - Added `calculateCappedProgression()` in progression.ts
  - Updated App.tsx to use capped progression for saving
  - Updated ConsoleView.tsx to show correct capped rank on End Screen
  - Fixed idle console to use saved career score (not calculation)
- **Testing:** 10 new test cases covering all scenarios

6 files modified, 161 tests pass.

### Previous Session Summary (2026-01-28)

**PRD.md Comprehensive Update — COMPLETE**

Deep codebase analysis to update PRD.md v6.0 with accurate implementation details:
- **8 parallel agents:** Analyzed constants, goop system, cracks, complications, progression, scoring, controls, actives
- **Formula corrections:** Crack growth 7-12s random (not fixed 5s), win burst requires <90% pressure
- **Tech notes added:** Buffer rows, zone boundaries with upgrades, iOS touch handling, lock delay reduction
- **Scoring clarification:** Adjacency bonus NOT multiplied by combo (important detail)
- **New tables:** Cumulative XP, fill duration examples, Goop Dump constants
- **Upgrade interactions:** Documented all upgrade effects on base constants

1 file modified (PRD.md), 151 tests pass.

### Previous Session Summary (2026-01-28)

**Corrupted Piece Mechanics — COMPLETE**

Implemented proper behavior for corrupted (corner-connected) pieces:
- **isCorrupted flag:** Added to GoopTemplate to track corrupted pieces at spawn
- **No Mixed:** Corrupted pieces can't become multi-color split pieces
- **No Wild:** Corrupted pieces can't become wild pieces; wild always uses normal pool
- **LooseGoop on lock:** Added getFloatingBlocks() check after every piece locks
- **Corner-connected cells split:** updateGroups() already splits them, now they fall properly

2 files modified (types.ts, GameEngine.ts), 151 tests pass.

### Previous Session Summary (2026-01-27)

---

**Previous Session Summary**

**Phase 21 Discussion Complete**

Extensive `/gsd:discuss-phase 21` session defining piece shape changes:

1. **Core insight:** Goal is sealing cracks, not making lines. Cracks spawn higher as pressure rises. BIGGER pieces help reach cracks, not smaller.

2. **Piece progression designed:**
   - Tetra (4-cell) → Penta (5-cell) → Hexa (6-cell) based on pressure height
   - Exclusive spawning (one size at a time)
   - Thresholds: row 13 for penta, row 8 for hexa

3. **Timing balanced:**
   - Extended game to 75 seconds (from 60)
   - Adjusted base fall (780ms) and fast drop (8x factor)
   - Target: 5-6 pieces per 25-second zone

4. **Custom pieces designed:**
   - User created `art/minos.svg` with all piece shapes
   - 54 base pieces: 27 normal + 27 corrupted
   - Corrupted = non-contiguous (corner-touching cells)
   - 15% corruption chance, 50% mirror chance for asymmetric

5. **Pieces trimmed from standard sets:**
   - Hexominoes: removed #3, 4, 9, 18, 21, 23, 27
   - Pentominoes: removed N piece
   - Custom designs replace standard polyominoes

**Previous Session (same day)**

**iOS Touch Controls Fix (Build 24-29)**

Fixed swipe/drag controls not working on iPhone Chrome/Safari/DuckDuckGo:

1. **Root cause:** iOS WebKit has incomplete Pointer Events support
2. **Initial attempts that failed:**
   - Synthetic PointerEvents from TouchEvents (iOS ignores synthetic currentTarget)
   - useEffect-based window listeners (too slow for fast swipes)
   - User agent detection (missed DuckDuckGo and other browsers)
3. **Final fix (multiple parts):**
   - Added Touch Events handlers alongside Pointer Events
   - Window listeners added SYNCHRONOUSLY in touchstart (not via async useEffect)
   - Fixed vertical drag threshold (was 20px, now 0px for soft drop)
   - Added `pointer-events: none` to SVG so touches pass through to parent div
4. **Verified working** on iPhone Chrome and DuckDuckGo by external tester

**Previous Session (same day)**

**Color Schedule Rework + Wild Pieces**

1. **Color schedule restructured:**
   - Purple now unlocks at rank 10 (was 20)
   - Orange removed from palette (kept for save compatibility)
   - Black unlocks at rank 50 (new max rank color)
   - Rank 20: Multi-color pieces only (no new color)

2. **Max rank reduced** from 100 to 50

3. **Wild pieces implemented** (rank 40+, 15% spawn chance):
   - Rainbow wave visual: color cycles through palette left-to-right
   - Seals ANY crack color on landing
   - Spreads wild to ENTIRE adjacent goop group
   - When non-wild lands next to wild: converts ENTIRE wild group

4. **P0 bug fixed:** Board disappeared when wild piece spawned
   - Root cause: negative modulo in `getWildColorAtX` caused undefined palette access
   - Fix: use `Math.abs(screenX)` and fallback colors

5. **P0 bug fixed:** Board disappeared when wild piece locked
   - Root cause: `minX` used before `let` declaration in `GameBoard.tsx:355`
   - JavaScript temporal dead zone caused ReferenceError when `hasWildCells` was true
   - Fix: moved bounds calculation before `fillColor` assignment

6. **CLAUDE.md updated** with mandatory Handoff Block format
   - After code changes: tests → restart server → build # → handoff block
   - User was wasting tokens correcting missed steps

**Previous Session (same day)**

- CrackManager extraction, command updates, build number process clarification

**Previous Session (same day)**

- Added Core Rules checklists (CLAUDE.md)
- Added PostToolUse auto-test hook
- Added context compaction preservation rules
- Researched power user Claude Code techniques

**Earlier Session (same day)**

- SessionStart hook implemented
- Added `<research>` and `<askme>` commands
- Consolidated Known Issues tracking

**Previous Session (SOP & Workflow Overhaul)**

1. **Distance penalty increased to 25%** (v1.1.46)
   - `core/GameEngine.ts:1198` — changed from 0.15 to 0.25
   - Cracks now limited to ~3 cells instead of ~4-6

2. **Ghost piece visibility improved** (v1.1.46-48)
   - Added transparent color fill (20% opacity) behind dashed outline
   - Fixed: `getContourPath` creates disconnected lines (unfillable), switched to `<rect>`
   - Outline opacity increased to 75%
   - Helps distinguish orange vs red, and split-color pieces

3. **O piece rotation fixed for split-colors** (v1.1.49-50)
   - Previously skipped rotation entirely (optimization for single-color)
   - v1.1.49: Enabled rotation but piece jumped (rotated around 0,0)
   - v1.1.50: Fixed — rotates `cellColors` array instead of cell positions
   - Shape stays in place, colors rotate visually around center

4. **XP curve flattened** (v1.1.51)
   - Old: `(rank+2) * (1750 + 250*rank)` — ~7M to rank 40
   - New: `3500 + (rank * 250)` per rank — ~336K to rank 40
   - Much more achievable progression

**Future ideas captured:**
- `SlowMode` concept in [[PROJECT]] (pressure from goop volume, crack-based leveling)
- `GoopPieceRework` branch created for next milestone (different goop shapes)

**Next session:** Start GoopPieceRework milestone — different piece shapes to facilitate faster stacking

**All deployed to:** https://thebluemuzzy.github.io/GOOPS/
